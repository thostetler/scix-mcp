    "content": "## Metrics\n### The Citation Metrics Report\nThe Citation Metrics Report is an overview of citations, usage and derived indicators for a set of SciX records. This means that all quantities in this overview are solely based on data from SciX. For each paper, a “read” is counted if a SciX user runs a search in our system and then requests to either view the paper’s full bibliographic record or download the fulltext. Please note that in computing readership numbers we attempt to remove log entries generated by robots, users coming to a SciX record from an external search engine, and multiple clicks from the same user. SciX has an automated procedure that attempts to match the references in the bibliography of a record to existing records in SciX database. If a SciX record has N references associated with it, it means that the corresponding paper has at least N references in its bibliography, but potentially more if there were references that our procedure was unable to match. Keep this in mind when regarding citation and citation-derived information.\n### How to View Metrics:\n  * To access the metrics view for a list of results, on the search results page go to the Explore button –> Metrics.\n  * To access metrics for a single article, go to the article detail view and find the metrics in the left-hand navigation.\n\n\n### Citation Metrics\nNote that we do not remove self-citations based on author name, because of author disambiguation problems. We apply a list-based removal of self-citations.\n### Normalized Citations\nFor a list of N papers (i=1,…N), where Nauthi is the number of authors for publication i and Ci the number of citations that this paper received, the normalized citation count for each article is Ci/Nauthi, and the ‘normalized citations’ for this list of N papers is the sum of these N numbers.\n### Article Usage Metrics\nSciX collects information about the rate that articles have been accessed in our system. This data includes both short-term access data (recent views) and records of article access rates over the years. **Article usage** rates include both page views of the article detail page in SciX, and full-text downloads of the article. The value for just the **full-text downloads** is presented as a seperate field in the metrics page.\n### Recent Views\nThis data encompasses the past 90 days of access data for articles in SciX, including full-text downloads. This value also includes read and download information from arXiv. You can sort a list of SciX search results by this value, or view it in the [results graph visualization](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix/visualize#results-graph).\n### Metrics for Indices\n#### h-index\nHirsch’s h-index is the largest number H such that H publications have at least H citations. It attempts to measure the productivity and impact of a researcher in a single number. [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_index \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_index\")\n#### m-index\nThe m-index is the h-index divided by the time (years) between the first and most recent publication.\n#### iN-index (where N is 10 or 100)\nThe iN-index is the number of publications with at least N citations.\n#### g-index\nGiven a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g-index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g articles received (together) at least g2 citations.\n#### tori-index\nThe total research impact of a scholar (tori) is calculated using the reference lists of the citing papers, where self-citations are removed. The contribution of each citing paper is then normalized by the number of remaining references in the citing papers and the number of authors in the cited paper. The tori-index is defined as the amount of work that others have devoted to his/her research, measured in research papers (see [Pepe & Kurtz 2012](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract \"https://scixplorer.org/#abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract\")).\n#### riq-index\nThe research impact quotient (riq) equals the square root of the tori-index, divided by the time between the first and last publication, multiplied by 1000 (see [Pepe & Kurtz 2012](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract \"https://scixplorer.org/#abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract\")).\n#### read10-index\nRead10 is the current readership rate for all an individual’s papers published in the most recent ten years, normalized for number of authors (see [Kurtz et al. 2005](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2005JASIS..56..111K/abstract \"The Bibliometric Properties of Article Readership Information\")).\n### Paper Count Metrics\n#### Normalized paper count\nFor a list of N papers (i=1,…N), where Nauthi is the number of authors for publication i, the normalized paper count is the sum over 1/Nauthi\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "subsection": "What's New",
    "content": "## Bibcodes\nThe SciX uses bibliographic codes (bibcodes) to identify literature in our database. Using a standard bibliographic format, as explained below, we can easily identify different articles and users can efficiently search for them. The bibcode is a 19 digit identifier which describes the journal article. The format was originally adopted by the SIMBAD and NED projects, and follows the syntax: YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA where:\n  * YYYY: Year of publication\n  * JJJJJ: A standard abbreviation for the journal (e.g. ApJ, AJ, MNRAS, Sci, PASP, etc.). A list of abbreviations is available.\n  * VVVV: The volume number (for a serial) or an abbreviation that specifies what type of publication it is (e.g. conf for conference proceedings, meet for Meeting proceedings, book for a book, coll for colloquium proceedings, proc for any other type of proceedings).\n  * M: Qualifier for publication: \n    * E: Electronic Abstract (usually a counter, not a page number)\n    * L: Letter\n    * P: Pink page\n    * Q-Z: Unduplicating character for identical codes\n  * PPPP: Page number. Note that for page numbers greater than 9999, the page number is continued in the m column.\n  * A: The first letter of the last name of the first author.\n\n\nThe fields are padded with periods (.) so that the code is always 19 characters long. The journal is left-justified within its 5 characters, and the volume and page are right-justified. New journal abbreviations should be unique, and follow existing naming conventions. As an example, the bibliographic code: 1992ApJ…400L…1W corresponds to the article: Astrophysical Journal Letters volume 400, page L1.\nAs many publishers are moving away from page numbers and using electronic identifiers more and more frequently, the page field is no longer guaranteed to be numeric. Often an identifier of more than 5 digits is truncated, and there may be letters, periods, dashes, or other characters in the page field as well. The volume field may also contain non-numeric characters.\nModern bibcodes are likely to be deprecated in the future, and users should not depend on semantic meaning represented in the bibcode.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## Export Results\n### How to Export Results\nSciX provides the ability to export results into various formats. There are two options:\n  1. **Export All Results:** From the results page, find the **Bulk Actions** dropdown menu in the top right of the page. From there, you can select a format.\n  2. **Export Selected Results:** From the results page, find the **Bulk Actions** dropdown menu in the top right of the page. From there, you will see **selected papers** checked, and you can select a format.\n\n\nWhen the tool is opened, you will have the opportunity to review the export result and either download or copy to clipboard.\n### Export Formats\nUse this button to export your search results in different formats. Currently available options are:\n###### 1. Tagged Formats:\n  * BibTeX\n  * BibTeX ABS\n  * ADS (generic tagged abstracts)\n  * EndNote\n  * ProCite\n  * RIS (Refman)\n  * RefWorks\n  * MEDLARS\n\n\n###### 2. LaTeX Formats:\n  * AASTeX\n  * Icarus\n  * MNRAS\n  * Solar Physics (SoPh)\n\n\n###### 3. XML Formats:\n  * DC (Dublin Core) XML\n  * REF-XML\n  * REFABS-XML\n  * VOTables\n  * RSS\n  * JATS XML\n\n\n### The BibTeX Format Configuration\nFor the two BibTeX formats there are two optional parameters `maxauthor` and `keyformat` which can be specified in user preferences.\n`maxauthor` is maxinum number of authors displayed if number of authors exceed 200. The default values for `maxauthor` for _BibTeX_ and _BibTeX ABS_ are respectively 10 and 0, where 0 means display all authors.\n`keyformat` is mnemonic key for identifying a BibTeX entry where default is the bibcode. Key can be specified to contain the first author’s last name, or some combination of publication year, journal, or additional authors. The key generation algorithm can be specified as a custom format. For example, the default BibTeX export for `2019AAS...23338108A` is:\n```\n@INPROCEEDINGS{2019AAS...23338108A,\n       author = {{Accomazzi}, Alberto and {Kurtz}, Michael J. and {Henneken}, Edwin and\n...\n}\n\n```\n\nwhich can instead be defined to be one of the following:\n```\nAccomazzi:2019              -- %1H:%Y\nAccomazzi:2019:AAS          -- %1H:%Y:%q\nAccomazzi2019               -- %1H%Y\nAccomazzi2019AAS            -- %1H%Y%q\nAccomazziKurtz2019          -- %2H%Y\n\n```\n\nNote there is also `%zm` specifier that is used for enumeration. This format outputs a sequence of characters to the end of `keyformat` when it is not unique among selected records. For example having `keyformat` of `%1H%Y%zm` produces:\n```\nAccomazzi2019a\nAccomazzi2019b\nKurtz2019\n\n```\n\n### The SciX Custom Format\nThe custom format feature allows you to output SciX data in a completely user-defined format. For example, the following format\n`%l (%Y), %j, %V, %p.\\n`\nproduces a reference of the form:\n`Vinodkumar, Dharssi, I., Bally, J., Steinle, P., McJannet, D., & Walker, J. (2017), Water Resources Research,  53,  633.`\nwhere specifiers _l_ , _Y_ , _j_ , _V_ , and _p_ are, respectively, indicators of author list, year, journal name, volume, and page numbers, and _\\n_ is a new line indicator.\nThe custom format also allows you, for instance, to adapt your reference format to the requirements of a specific journal, or to build other types of output like HTML formatted references. For example, the format for Icarus is:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\bibitem[%2M(%Y)]{%R} %10I\\ %Y.\\ %T.\\ %j %V, %p-%P.\\n`\nwhich produces a reference of the form:\n`\\\\bibitem[Vinodkumar, et al.(2017)]{2017WRR....53..633V} Vinodkumar, Dharssi, I., Bally, J., Steinle, P., McJannet, D. and Walker, J.\\\\ 2017.\\\\ Comparison of\\nsoil wetness from multiple models over Australia with observations.\\\\ Water\\nResources Research 53, 633-646.`\nAs can be seen from the above examples, the format is specified as a string using a syntax similar to the one used by the C-programming _printf_ statement. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output; and conversion specifications, for any of the fields found in the bibliographic record to be formatted (e.g. authors, title).\nFurthermore, using custom format, you can format your output as a csv file. For example, the following format\n`%ZEncoding:csv %ZHeader:'Author,Year,Title,Journal' %G,%Y,%T,%J`\nwould create the four specified columns, listing your results under the column heading. Note that if no column heading is specified in your custom format, the export adds the headings based on your field selections.\nFor author field _l_ (please see table below for all author formats) there are optional parameters: _n.m_. If the number of authors in the list is larger than _n_ , the list will be truncated and returned as “author1, author2, …, author _m_ , et al.”. If ._m_ is not specified, _n_.1 is assumed. The format is as follows:\n`%[n.m]l` .\n#### Examples\nThe default format is the AASTeX format:\n`%ZEncoding:latex%ZLinelength:0\\bibitem[%4m(%Y)]{%R} %5.3l\\ %Y, %j, %V, %p.\\n`\nwhich produces a reference of the form:\n`\\bibitem[Rester, et al.(1989)]{1989ApJ...342L..71R} Rester, A.~C., Coldwell, R.~L. \\& Dunnam, F.~E., et al.\\ 1989, \\\\apj, 342, L71.`\nThe format for Icarus is:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\bibitem[%2M(%Y)]{%R} %10I\\ %Y.\\ %T.\\ %j %V, %p-%P.\\n`\nThe format for MNRAS is:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\bibitem[\\\\protect\\\\citename{%1h}{%Y}]{%R} %8.3g,%Y,%q, %V,%p\\n`\nA format to create list of records with hyperlinked title is:\n`%ZEncoding:html<P>%a %Y, %J <A href=\"%u\">%T</A>\\n`\nA format to create a list of records with hyperlinked bibcode, authors, title, journal, volume, page, year for use in latex:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\item \\href{%u}{%R} %A: \\textit{%T,} %j,%V,%p (%Y)`\nThe same format as above but encoded for use as a rich text document (rtf) which can be edited in textedit, word, etc.\n`%ZHeader:\"{\\\\rtf1\\n\\n\" %ZFooter:\"}\"%zn. {\\\\field{\\\\*\\\\fldinst HYPERLINK \"%u\"}{\\\\fldrslt %R }} %A: \\\\i %T,\\\\i0%q,%V,%p (%Y)\\\\line\\`\n#### Author formats\nThere are 18 author formats in the custom format.\nAuthor formats for **last name** only\n**_and_** | **Format** | **Specifier** | **Abbreviated** | **Example** | **Example Abbreviated %3.2**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \ntext | lastname | **%f** | \\emph{et al.} | -Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, and Accomazzi  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi | -Henneken, Muench \\emph{et al.}  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi  \ntext | first author only if number of authors > 2 otherwise both authors  \n  \nnote these are separated by spaces not commas | **%H** |  | -Henneken  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi | -Henneken Muench  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi  \nsymbol | first author only if number of authors > 2 otherwise both authors  \n  \nnote these are separated by spaces not commas | **%h** |  | -Henneken  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi | -Henneken Muench  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi  \ntext | lastname | **%M** | et al. | -Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, and Accomazzi  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi | -Henneken, Muench et al.  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi  \nsymbol | lastname | **%m** | et al. | -Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, & Accomazzi  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi | -Henneken, Muench et al.  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi  \nnone | first author only lastname+ | **%n** |  | -Henneken,+  \n-Kurtz,+ | -Henneken,+  \n-Kurtz,+  \nAuthor formats for **full name**\n**_and_** | **First Name** | **First Author vs The Rest** | **Format** | **Specifier** | **Abbreviated** | **Example** | **Example Abbreviated %3.2**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \ntext | in full if available | same | lastname, firstname m. | **%A** | , and xxx colleagues | -Henneken, E.

    "content": "## Journal Macros\n## Journal Abbreviations used in the SciX BibTeX entries\nSome of the LaTeX-compatible reference formats created by SciX contain macros that need to be properly expanded by TeX or LaTeX in order to produce the correct output. Since the particular formatting depends on the macro package used by the author or publisher and since these formats change with time, we suggest that users always resolve these macros by incorporating the appropriate style file in their documents. The most popular set of macros in use today in astronomy are the ones defined in the [AASTeX](https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/) package and supported by the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. If you use any of the TeX-based formats generated by SciX, you should consider installing and incorporating the AASTeX macros to facilitate the preparation of your manuscript.\nHowever, if for some reason you do not want or are not able to use the AAS macro package, you have the option of incorporating just the macros in your paper as described below. The following macros are taken from the [AASTeX macro package](https://journals.aas.org/aastexguide/#abbreviations) version 6.3.1. You will need to include these macros in your LaTeX source only if you are not using the AASTeX package and need to resolve the macro definitions found in the BibTeX entries returned by SciX. You can copy the needed macros from the table below, or download the .sty file to include in your LaTeX source [here](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix/aas_macros.sty).\n**TeX Macro** | **Journal Name**  \n---|---  \n\\aas | American Astronomical Society Meeting Abstracts  \n\\aj | Astronomical Journal  \n\\actaa | Acta Astronomica  \n\\araa | Annual Review of Astron and Astrophysis  \n\\apj | Astrophysical Journal  \n\\apjl | Astrophysical Journal, Letters  \n\\apjs | Astrophysical Journal, Supplement  \n\\ao | Applied Optics  \n\\apss | Astrophysics and Space Science  \n\\aap | Astronomy and Astrophysics  \n\\aapr | Astronomy and Astrophysics Reviews  \n\\aaps | Astronomy and Astrophysics, Supplement  \n\\aplett | Astrophysics Letters  \n\\apspr | Astrophysics Space Physics Research  \n\\azh | Astronomicheskii Zhurnal  \n\\baas | Bulletin of the AAS  \n\\bain | Bulletin Astronomical Institute of the Netherlands  \n\\caa | Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics  \n\\cjaa | Chinese Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics  \n\\dps | American Astronomical Society/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts  \n\\fcp | Fundamental Cosmic Physics  \n\\gca | Geochimica Cosmochimica Acta  \n\\grl | Geophysics Research Letters  \n\\iaucirc | IAU Cirulars  \n\\icarus | Icarus  \n\\jaavso | Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers  \n\\jcap | Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics  \n\\jcp | Journal of Chemical Physics  \n\\jgr | Journal of Geophysics Research  \n\\jqsrt | Journal of Quantitiative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer  \n\\jrasc | Journal of the RAS of Canada  \n\\maps | Meteoritics and Planetary Science  \n\\memras | Memoirs of the RAS  \n\\memsai | Mem.

The second factor is a boost factor for more highly read and cited papers. This boost factor is designed to more highly rank papers that are relevant and popular now and is calculated via an age-normalized combination of reads and citation.\n### Metrics\n### The Citation Metrics Report\nThe Citation Metrics Report is an overview of citations, usage and derived indicators for a set of SciX records. This means that all quantities in this overview are solely based on data from SciX. For each paper, a “read” is counted if a SciX user runs a search in our system and then requests to either view the paper’s full bibliographic record or download the fulltext. Please note that in computing readership numbers we attempt to remove log entries generated by robots, users coming to a SciX record from an external search engine, and multiple clicks from the same user. SciX has an automated procedure that attempts to match the references in the bibliography of a record to existing records in SciX database. If a SciX record has N references associated with it, it means that the corresponding paper has at least N references in its bibliography, but potentially more if there were references that our procedure was unable to match. Keep this in mind when regarding citation and citation-derived information.\n### How to View Metrics:\n  * To access the metrics view for a list of results, on the search results page go to the Explore button –> Metrics.\n  * To access metrics for a single article, go to the article detail view and find the metrics in the left-hand navigation.\n\n\n### Citation Metrics\nNote that we do not remove self-citations based on author name, because of author disambiguation problems. We apply a list-based removal of self-citations.\n### Normalized Citations\nFor a list of N papers (i=1,…N), where Nauthi is the number of authors for publication i and Ci the number of citations that this paper received, the normalized citation count for each article is Ci/Nauthi, and the ‘normalized citations’ for this list of N papers is the sum of these N numbers.\n### Article Usage Metrics\nSciX collects information about the rate that articles have been accessed in our system. This data includes both short-term access data (recent views) and records of article access rates over the years. **Article usage** rates include both page views of the article detail page in SciX, and full-text downloads of the article. The value for just the **full-text downloads** is presented as a seperate field in the metrics page.\n### Recent Views\nThis data encompasses the past 90 days of access data for articles in SciX, including full-text downloads. This value also includes read and download information from arXiv. You can sort a list of SciX search results by this value, or view it in the [results graph visualization](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix/visualize#results-graph).\n### Metrics for Indices\n#### h-index\nHirsch’s h-index is the largest number H such that H publications have at least H citations. It attempts to measure the productivity and impact of a researcher in a single number. [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_index \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_index\")\n#### m-index\nThe m-index is the h-index divided by the time (years) between the first and most recent publication.\n#### iN-index (where N is 10 or 100)\nThe iN-index is the number of publications with at least N citations.\n#### g-index\nGiven a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g-index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g articles received (together) at least g2 citations.\n#### tori-index\nThe total research impact of a scholar (tori) is calculated using the reference lists of the citing papers, where self-citations are removed. The contribution of each citing paper is then normalized by the number of remaining references in the citing papers and the number of authors in the cited paper. The tori-index is defined as the amount of work that others have devoted to his/her research, measured in research papers (see [Pepe & Kurtz 2012](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract \"https://scixplorer.org/#abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract\")).\n#### riq-index\nThe research impact quotient (riq) equals the square root of the tori-index, divided by the time between the first and last publication, multiplied by 1000 (see [Pepe & Kurtz 2012](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract \"https://scixplorer.org/#abs/2012PLoSO...746428P/abstract\")).\n#### read10-index\nRead10 is the current readership rate for all an individual’s papers published in the most recent ten years, normalized for number of authors (see [Kurtz et al. 2005](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2005JASIS..56..111K/abstract \"The Bibliometric Properties of Article Readership Information\")).\n### Paper Count Metrics\n#### Normalized paper count\nFor a list of N papers (i=1,…N), where Nauthi is the number of authors for publication i, the normalized paper count is the sum over 1/Nauthi\n### Export Results\n### How to Export Results\nSciX provides the ability to export results into various formats. There are two options:\n  1. **Export All Results:** From the results page, find the **Bulk Actions** dropdown menu in the top right of the page. From there, you can select a format.\n  2. **Export Selected Results:** From the results page, find the **Bulk Actions** dropdown menu in the top right of the page. From there, you will see **selected papers** checked, and you can select a format.\n\n\nWhen the tool is opened, you will have the opportunity to review the export result and either download or copy to clipboard.\n### Export Formats\nUse this button to export your search results in different formats. Currently available options are:\n###### 1. Tagged Formats:\n  * BibTeX\n  * BibTeX ABS\n  * ADS (generic tagged abstracts)\n  * EndNote\n  * ProCite\n  * RIS (Refman)\n  * RefWorks\n  * MEDLARS\n\n\n###### 2. LaTeX Formats:\n  * AASTeX\n  * Icarus\n  * MNRAS\n  * Solar Physics (SoPh)\n\n\n###### 3. XML Formats:\n  * DC (Dublin Core) XML\n  * REF-XML\n  * REFABS-XML\n  * VOTables\n  * RSS\n  * JATS XML\n\n\n### The BibTeX Format Configuration\nFor the two BibTeX formats there are two optional parameters `maxauthor` and `keyformat` which can be specified in user preferences.\n`maxauthor` is maxinum number of authors displayed if number of authors exceed 200. The default values for `maxauthor` for _BibTeX_ and _BibTeX ABS_ are respectively 10 and 0, where 0 means display all authors.\n`keyformat` is mnemonic key for identifying a BibTeX entry where default is the bibcode. Key can be specified to contain the first author’s last name, or some combination of publication year, journal, or additional authors. The key generation algorithm can be specified as a custom format. For example, the default BibTeX export for `2019AAS...23338108A` is:\n```\n@INPROCEEDINGS{2019AAS...23338108A,\n       author = {{Accomazzi}, Alberto and {Kurtz}, Michael J. and {Henneken}, Edwin and\n...\n}\n\n```\n\nwhich can instead be defined to be one of the following:\n```\nAccomazzi:2019              -- %1H:%Y\nAccomazzi:2019:AAS          -- %1H:%Y:%q\nAccomazzi2019               -- %1H%Y\nAccomazzi2019AAS            -- %1H%Y%q\nAccomazziKurtz2019          -- %2H%Y\n\n```\n\nNote there is also `%zm` specifier that is used for enumeration. This format outputs a sequence of characters to the end of `keyformat` when it is not unique among selected records. For example having `keyformat` of `%1H%Y%zm` produces:\n```\nAccomazzi2019a\nAccomazzi2019b\nKurtz2019\n\n```\n\n### The SciX Custom Format\nThe custom format feature allows you to output SciX data in a completely user-defined format. For example, the following format\n`%l (%Y), %j, %V, %p.\\n`\nproduces a reference of the form:\n`Vinodkumar, Dharssi, I., Bally, J., Steinle, P., McJannet, D., & Walker, J. (2017), Water Resources Research,  53,  633.`\nwhere specifiers _l_ , _Y_ , _j_ , _V_ , and _p_ are, respectively, indicators of author list, year, journal name, volume, and page numbers, and _\\n_ is a new line indicator.\nThe custom format also allows you, for instance, to adapt your reference format to the requirements of a specific journal, or to build other types of output like HTML formatted references. For example, the format for Icarus is:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\bibitem[%2M(%Y)]{%R} %10I\\ %Y.\\ %T.\\ %j %V, %p-%P.\\n`\nwhich produces a reference of the form:\n`\\\\bibitem[Vinodkumar, et al.(2017)]{2017WRR....53..633V} Vinodkumar, Dharssi, I., Bally, J., Steinle, P., McJannet, D. and Walker, J.\\\\ 2017.\\\\ Comparison of\\nsoil wetness from multiple models over Australia with observations.\\\\ Water\\nResources Research 53, 633-646.`\nAs can be seen from the above examples, the format is specified as a string using a syntax similar to the one used by the C-programming _printf_ statement. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output; and conversion specifications, for any of the fields found in the bibliographic record to be formatted (e.g. authors, title).\nFurthermore, using custom format, you can format your output as a csv file. For example, the following format\n`%ZEncoding:csv %ZHeader:'Author,Year,Title,Journal' %G,%Y,%T,%J`\nwould create the four specified columns, listing your results under the column heading. Note that if no column heading is specified in your custom format, the export adds the headings based on your field selections.\nFor author field _l_ (please see table below for all author formats) there are optional parameters: _n.m_. If the number of authors in the list is larger than _n_ , the list will be truncated and returned as “author1, author2, …, author _m_ , et al.”. If ._m_ is not specified, _n_.1 is assumed. The format is as follows:\n`%[n.m]l` .\n#### Examples\nThe default format is the AASTeX format:\n`%ZEncoding:latex%ZLinelength:0\\bibitem[%4m(%Y)]{%R} %5.3l\\ %Y, %j, %V, %p.\\n`\nwhich produces a reference of the form:\n`\\bibitem[Rester, et al.(1989)]{1989ApJ...342L..71R} Rester, A.~C., Coldwell, R.~L. \\& Dunnam, F.~E., et al.\\ 1989, \\\\apj, 342, L71.`\nThe format for Icarus is:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\bibitem[%2M(%Y)]{%R} %10I\\ %Y.\\ %T.\\ %j %V, %p-%P.\\n`\nThe format for MNRAS is:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\bibitem[\\\\protect\\\\citename{%1h}{%Y}]{%R} %8.3g,%Y,%q, %V,%p\\n`\nA format to create list of records with hyperlinked title is:\n`%ZEncoding:html<P>%a %Y, %J <A href=\"%u\">%T</A>\\n`\nA format to create a list of records with hyperlinked bibcode, authors, title, journal, volume, page, year for use in latex:\n`%ZEncoding:latex\\\\item \\href{%u}{%R} %A: \\textit{%T,} %j,%V,%p (%Y)`\nThe same format as above but encoded for use as a rich text document (rtf) which can be edited in textedit, word, etc.\n`%ZHeader:\"{\\\\rtf1\\n\\n\" %ZFooter:\"}\"%zn. {\\\\field{\\\\*\\\\fldinst HYPERLINK \"%u\"}{\\\\fldrslt %R }} %A: \\\\i %T,\\\\i0%q,%V,%p (%Y)\\\\line\\`\n#### Author formats\nThere are 18 author formats in the custom format.\nAuthor formats for **last name** only\n**_and_** | **Format** | **Specifier** | **Abbreviated** | **Example** | **Example Abbreviated %3.2**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \ntext | lastname | **%f** | \\emph{et al.} | -Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, and Accomazzi  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi | -Henneken, Muench \\emph{et al.}  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi  \ntext | first author only if number of authors > 2 otherwise both authors  \n  \nnote these are separated by spaces not commas | **%H** |  | -Henneken  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi | -Henneken Muench  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi  \nsymbol | first author only if number of authors > 2 otherwise both authors  \n  \nnote these are separated by spaces not commas | **%h** |  | -Henneken  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi | -Henneken Muench  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi  \ntext | lastname | **%M** | et al. | -Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, and Accomazzi  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi | -Henneken, Muench et al.  \n-Kurtz and Accomazzi  \nsymbol | lastname | **%m** | et al. | -Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, & Accomazzi  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi | -Henneken, Muench et al.  \n-Kurtz & Accomazzi  \nnone | first author only lastname+ | **%n** |  | -Henneken,+  \n-Kurtz,+ | -Henneken,+  \n-Kurtz,+  \nAuthor formats for **full name**\n**_and_** | **First Name** | **First Author vs The Rest** | **Format** | **Specifier** | **Abbreviated** | **Example** | **Example Abbreviated %3.2**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \ntext | in full if available | same | lastname, firstname m. | **%A** | , and xxx colleagues | -Henneken, E.

It must be the first command specified in a format string, and there can be multiple _%Z_ directives at the beginning of the string. While the _Z_ tag produces no output, it allows you to specify the value of certain variables with corresponding parameters. It has the following syntax: **%Zcommand:parameter**. The parameter can be a number, a word, or a string, depending on the command. If it is a string, it must be enclosed in double quotes. The available commands are:\n\n\n### Author Affiliation\nThe Author Affiliation report allows you to create a list of all coauthors, and their affiliations, for a given author. This is especially useful to meet the requirements of some grant applications, such as for the NSF collaborator form.\nTo create this report for yourself:\n  1. First search for all of your papers using your name, your ORCID ID, or a SciX library of your papers (click the “view library in search results page” button on your library).\n  2. From the search results page, click the Bulk Actions menu in the upper right, then choose “Author Affiliation”.\n  3. Use the “authors” and “years” drop down menus at the top of the report to choose the first N number of authors per paper and the past Y number of years (as specified by the grant agency) for the report.\n  4. Check over and clean the report, selecting or deselecting your co-authors and their affiliations as needed.\n  5. When satisfied, use the drop down menu at the top to select your export format and export the results.\n\n\n### Visualize Results\n### Author Network\nThe author network detects **groups of authors** and **connections between those groups** within a set of results.\n#### How the network is made\nThe author network takes the top 200 most frequently appearing authors within your result set, measures the frequency of collaboration between them, and displays color-coded groups of authors organized around a center point.\n#### How to use it\nClicking on an inside edge of a group will show you all papers from that group. Clicking on an outside edge, or an author name, will show you all papers by that particular author.\n    * To find authors who collaborate not only within their group but outside of it, check the “view link overlay” box and see which authors tend to collaborate with authors in other groups.\n    * To see the collaborations that have been most fruitful in terms of citations yielded, under “Size wedges based on”, click “Paper Citations”.\n\n\n### Paper Network\nThe paper network detects **groups of papers** based on **shared references** between those papers. In general, papers with many shared references will tend to have similar topics.\n#### How the network is made\nThe paper network creates groups of papers that share a significant number of references, and names those groups by looking for shared, unique words in their titles.\n#### How to use it\n\n\n### Results Graph\nWhen you look at a list of SciX search results, you can sort by date published, by citation count, or by recent popularity of the article in SciX, but you cannot see all of these dimensions at once, and you cannot easily see outliers. The results graph is a customizable scatter chart that allows you to assign values to the x and y axes as well as to the radius of the circle representing a paper.\n#### How to use it\n\n\n### Concept Cloud\nThe concept cloud shows you **frequently appearing** and **unique words** in your search results.\n#### How the concept cloud is made\nThe concept cloud takes words from the titles and abstracts of your search results, counts their frequencies and compares them to the same word’s frequency across the entire SciX corpus.\n#### How to use it\n  * Move the slider to the left of the concept cloud towards “unique” to see those words that appeared relatively frequently in your results but rarely in the rest of SciX.\n  * Move the slider to the left of the concept cloud towards “frequent” to see those words that appear frequently in your results, regardless of how often they appear in the rest of SciX.\n\n\n### Instructions on Downloading Graphics as High-Quality PNGS in Chrome\n  1. [ Install the SVG Crowbar 2 Bookmarklet](https://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/)\n  2. Open the graph in SciX (currently the paper and author networks have the best support)\n  3. Click the SVG Crowbar icon, you will see something that looks a bit messy, like this:\n  4. Click on the two bottom buttons: **#network-viz-main-chart** to download the main chart, and **#network-viz-time-series** to download the accompanying time series graph.\n\n\n### Article View\nClicking on the title of an individual article will bring you to a page showing the abstract view for the chosen article including Publication data, DOI link, keywords and arXiv identifier. On this page you will find links to lists of:\n  * Citations to the article\n  * References in the article\n  * Co-Reads of the article (papers that have been read by people who read this article)\n  * Graphics in the article\n\n\nExport functions will allow you to export the article metadata in available formats (see [Export Results](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix/export) for a full list of formats)\nYou can also generate the metrics for the individual article by selecting metrics from the Analyze list.\nIn addition you will find links to Full Text Sources (Open Access resources are indicated by an open lock) and Data Products. Also shown will be a list of Suggested Articles which are suggested based upon the information for the chosen article.\n### Bibcodes\nThe SciX uses bibliographic codes (bibcodes) to identify literature in our database. Using a standard bibliographic format, as explained below, we can easily identify different articles and users can efficiently search for them. The bibcode is a 19 digit identifier which describes the journal article. The format was originally adopted by the SIMBAD and NED projects, and follows the syntax: YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA where:\n  * YYYY: Year of publication\n  * JJJJJ: A standard abbreviation for the journal (e.g. ApJ, AJ, MNRAS, Sci, PASP, etc.). A list of abbreviations is available.\n  * VVVV: The volume number (for a serial) or an abbreviation that specifies what type of publication it is (e.g. conf for conference proceedings, meet for Meeting proceedings, book for a book, coll for colloquium proceedings, proc for any other type of proceedings).\n  * M: Qualifier for publication: \n    * E: Electronic Abstract (usually a counter, not a page number)\n    * L: Letter\n    * P: Pink page\n    * Q-Z: Unduplicating character for identical codes\n  * PPPP: Page number. Note that for page numbers greater than 9999, the page number is continued in the m column.\n  * A: The first letter of the last name of the first author.\n\n\nThe fields are padded with periods (.) so that the code is always 19 characters long. The journal is left-justified within its 5 characters, and the volume and page are right-justified. New journal abbreviations should be unique, and follow existing naming conventions. As an example, the bibliographic code: 1992ApJ…400L…1W corresponds to the article: Astrophysical Journal Letters volume 400, page L1.\nAs many publishers are moving away from page numbers and using electronic identifiers more and more frequently, the page field is no longer guaranteed to be numeric. Often an identifier of more than 5 digits is truncated, and there may be letters, periods, dashes, or other characters in the page field as well. The volume field may also contain non-numeric characters.\nModern bibcodes are likely to be deprecated in the future, and users should not depend on semantic meaning represented in the bibcode.\n### Journal Macros\n## Journal Abbreviations used in the SciX BibTeX entries\nSome of the LaTeX-compatible reference formats created by SciX contain macros that need to be properly expanded by TeX or LaTeX in order to produce the correct output. Since the particular formatting depends on the macro package used by the author or publisher and since these formats change with time, we suggest that users always resolve these macros by incorporating the appropriate style file in their documents. The most popular set of macros in use today in astronomy are the ones defined in the [AASTeX](https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/) package and supported by the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. If you use any of the TeX-based formats generated by SciX, you should consider installing and incorporating the AASTeX macros to facilitate the preparation of your manuscript.\nHowever, if for some reason you do not want or are not able to use the AAS macro package, you have the option of incorporating just the macros in your paper as described below. The following macros are taken from the [AASTeX macro package](https://journals.aas.org/aastexguide/#abbreviations) version 6.3.1. You will need to include these macros in your LaTeX source only if you are not using the AASTeX package and need to resolve the macro definitions found in the BibTeX entries returned by SciX. You can copy the needed macros from the table below, or download the .sty file to include in your LaTeX source [here](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix/aas_macros.sty).\n**TeX Macro** | **Journal Name**  \n---|---  \n\\aas | American Astronomical Society Meeting Abstracts  \n\\aj | Astronomical Journal  \n\\actaa | Acta Astronomica  \n\\araa | Annual Review of Astron and Astrophysis  \n\\apj | Astrophysical Journal  \n\\apjl | Astrophysical Journal, Letters  \n\\apjs | Astrophysical Journal, Supplement  \n\\ao | Applied Optics  \n\\apss | Astrophysics and Space Science  \n\\aap | Astronomy and Astrophysics  \n\\aapr | Astronomy and Astrophysics Reviews  \n\\aaps | Astronomy and Astrophysics, Supplement  \n\\aplett | Astrophysics Letters  \n\\apspr | Astrophysics Space Physics Research  \n\\azh | Astronomicheskii Zhurnal  \n\\baas | Bulletin of the AAS  \n\\bain | Bulletin Astronomical Institute of the Netherlands  \n\\caa | Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics  \n\\cjaa | Chinese Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics  \n\\dps | American Astronomical Society/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts  \n\\fcp | Fundamental Cosmic Physics  \n\\gca | Geochimica Cosmochimica Acta  \n\\grl | Geophysics Research Letters  \n\\iaucirc | IAU Cirulars  \n\\icarus | Icarus  \n\\jaavso | Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers  \n\\jcap | Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics  \n\\jcp | Journal of Chemical Physics  \n\\jgr | Journal of Geophysics Research  \n\\jqsrt | Journal of Quantitiative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer  \n\\jrasc | Journal of the RAS of Canada  \n\\maps | Meteoritics and Planetary Science  \n\\memras | Memoirs of the RAS  \n\\memsai | Mem.

    "content": "## Bibgroups\n### What are Bibgroups?\nBibgroups are libraries that are curated by librarians, archivists and scientists who are not SciX employees. Descriptions of each bibgroup include information that details the coverage in the collection and frequency of updates. Many of the bibgroups include contact information for the maintainer.\n## Bibgroups\n  * [(CFHT) Canada-France-Hawaiʻi Telescope](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#cfht-canada-france-hawai%CA%BBi-telescope)\n  * [(ESO) European Southern Observatory Telescopes](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#eso-european-southern-observatory-telescopes)\n  * [(NOIRLab) National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#noirlab-national-optical-infrared-astronomy-research-laboratory)\n  * [(Pan-STARRS) Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#pan-starrs-panoramic-survey-telescope-and-rapid-response-system)\n  * [(SOHO) NASA-ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#soho-nasa-esa-solar-and-heliospheric-observatory)\n  * [(STEREO) Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#stereo-solar-terrestrial-relations-observatory)\n  * [(USGS) United States Geological Survey](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#usgs-united-states-geological-survey)\n  * [Copernicus, EUVE, FUSE, GALEX, IUE, K2, Kepler, and TESS](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/Bibgroups#copernicus-euve-fuse-galex-iue-k2-kepler-and-tess)\n\n\n### CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaiʻi Telescope)\n`bibgroup:CFHT` This bibliographic group includes peer reviewed papers by researchers worldwide using data from the [Canada-France-Hawaiʻi Telescope (CFHT)](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu). CFHT is located on Maunakea, land of the Kānaka Maoli people, and a mountain of considerable cultural, natural and ecological significance to the Indigenous Hawaiian people. It comprises all papers utilizing every instrument ever used at CFHT, dating back to 1979 when the first CFHT paper was published. The CFHT community consists primarily of scientists from Canada, France and the University of Hawaiʻi, and from institutions in Taiwan, China, Brazil and Korea, though research teams often include members outside this community. The list also features papers using [archival data](https://scixplorer.org/public-libraries/Ck5RwFaJQJqCwTq6huHbNQ) since 2013 and data from catalogs built with [CFHT data](https://scixplorer.org/public-libraries/kazCveSzRg6JWsyW469QiA) since 2015. The [contributions from the CFHT Legacy Survey to archival and catalog research](https://scixplorer.org/public-libraries/qNA7baMyTf2qbhZ5cYDlgg) are significant. Covering a wide array of topics, CFHT’s contributions span from the [discovery of Gravitational Arcs](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1987A%26A...172L..14S) and the characterization of [Dark Energy](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2006/07/aa4185-05.pdf) to studies of the light curve of [`Oumuamua`](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25020) and the discovery and follow-up of Near-Earth Objects and [Potential Hazardous Asteroids](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/media/newsletters/MPC_Newsletter_Dec2023.pdf), highlighting its significant impact on numerous scientific fields.\n### ESO (European Southern Observatory Telescopes)\n`bibgroup:ESO/Telescopes` This group contains refereed articles using data from ESO (European Southern Observatory) telescopes. Papers since publication year 1996 using data from Paranal (VLT, VLTI, VISTA, VST) or Chajnantor facilities (ESO observing time of APEX or ALMA) as well as La Silla papers since publication year 2000 reference the program IDs from which the data originated. They are linked to the corresponding raw data or data products located in the ESO Science Archive. The database is maintained by the ESO Library and can be queried in more detail at <https://telbib.eso.org>. It is updated daily. For further questions, please contact the ESO librarians at library@eso.org.\n### HST (Hubble Space Telescope)\n`bibgroup:HST` This group primarily contains refereed articles that made scientific use of data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) since 1991, which can be obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).

    "content": "## Technical Standards for Scanning Legacy Literature\nSciX contains extensive holdings of [historic astronomy and astrophysics literature](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp). As resources permit, we continue to digitize and ingest [relevant](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/journal_inclusion) items recommended by community members. In addition, we accept scans of [appropriate](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/journal_inclusion) material that meet these technical standards. Please contact the SciX curators before beginning your project to ensure we can accommodate your proposal. We will also determine an effective delivery method then.\nWe request that each page be scanned and saved as a single TIFF file. In all cases, a journal is scanned cover-to-cover with no pages skipped (even the blank ones). These images will need to comply with the following quality and naming requirements.\n## Quality requirements\nPages need to be scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi. Further requirements depend on the contents of the page. The following table specifies these requirements for each page type.\n**Parameter** | **Setting**  \n---|---  \n**Page type** | **Exclusively text and line art**  \nDynamic range | 1-sample/pixel and 1-bit/sample  \nCompression | CCITT G4 encoding, with all image data encoded in a single strip  \nPhotometric interpretation | min-is-white  \nPlanar configuration | single image plane  \nOrientation | portrait  \n**Page type** | **Page with gray-scale images**  \nDynamic range | 1-sample/pixel and 8-bits/sample  \nCompression | LZW or Deflate  \nPhotometric interpretation | min-is-black  \nPlanar configuration | single image plane  \nOrientation | portrait  \n**Page type** | **Page with color images**  \nDynamic range | 3-samples/pixel and 8-bits/sample  \nCompression | LZW or Deflate  \nPhotometric interpretation | RGB  \nPlanar configuration | single image plane  \nOrientation | portrait  \nIf a page contains both gray-scale and color content, follow the instructions for a page with color images.\nScanned images should have consistent borders around the text area and should be scanned in portrait orientation, with a maximum skewness of 2 degrees. Cropping of images is allowed, in order to clean up possible image contamination from paper borders. Resizing, however, is not allowed. The resolution of 600 dpi is to be maintained consistently. This means that the image dimensions divided by 600 should closely approximate the physical dimensions of the digitized area in inches.\n## Page numbering\nWe expect you will take quality assurance measures to guarantee that pages will not be skipped during the scanning process, causing file names to be out of sync with the sequence of pages in the journal.\nWe request that each page be scanned and saved as a single TIFF file, named after the journal acronym, volume and page number according to the templates described below; the journal acronym can be provided by the SciX team. If a journal acronym contains an ampersand (&), it needs to be replaced by a plus sign (+). Ideally, file extensions like .tif or .tiff should be omitted.\nTypically, a page in a journal is one of the 6 following types:\n\n\nThe file naming requirements for these page types are as follows:\n**Page type** | **Naming requirements**  \n---|---  \nRegular | The scans should be saved in files named JNLvvv.nnnn, where JNL is an abbreviation of the journal name, vvv is the volume number and nnnn is the zero-padded page number. For instance, page number 100 for volume 200 of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics (A+A) should be saved in a TIFF file named A+A200.0100. Note: some journals may contain pages that, although not numbered, have an implied page number which can be easily inferred by their position within the sequence of numbered pages. In all cases these pages should be named after the corresponding implied page number. Sometimes regular pages are a combination of a letter and a number, like A1, in which case the letter should get included in the page numbering; for instance, the page “A10” in volume 33 of the journal “M+PS” should be saved in a file named “M+PS033.A010.”. If a journal volume consists of multiple issues that all start on page 1, please contact us for more detailed instructions.  \nLetter | These pages are labeled with the letter “L” followed by an increasing number, starting from page L1. These scans should be saved in files named according to the following template: JNLvvv.Lnnn, where the file extension consists of the letter “L” followed by the zero-padded page number (three digits long).  \nInsert | If the physical size of the insert is 11” x 17” or smaller, a reduced copy of the scan should be created so that the resulting image size will match the typical page size of the journal being scanned. If the size of the insert is greater than 11” x 17”, then multiple scans of the different parts of the image should be performed, each having a scanning area size equal to the one used for the typical pages of the current journal. If such inserts are not numbered according to the regular page numbering scheme, they should be assigned a file name created by appending a 3-digit sequential number to the filename of the preceding page. For instance, an insert appearing after page 100 of volume 200 of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics should be saved in a file named A+A200.0100I001  \nPlate | The plate scans should be saved in files named according to the following template: JNLvvv.nnnnPppp, where the file extension consists of the current page number nnnn (or the preceding page if the plate does not have a page number associated with it), followed letter “P” followed by the zero-padded plate number displayed on the page (ppp).  \nFront matter | All pages preceding the “Regular” or letter pages and starting from the cover should be scanned and saved in files JNLvvv.nnnnCddd, where the file extension consists of the number corresponding to the first numbered page following the cover pages (nnnn), followed by the letter “C,” followed by a zero-padded sequence number (ddd). These pages are typically numbered using roman numerals and include all pages in the journal’s “front matter” section.  \nBack matter | All pages following the last numbered page (or plate) and ending with the back cover should be scanned and saved in files named JNLvvv.nnnnZddd, where the file extension consists of the number corresponding to the last numbered page preceding the back-cover pages (nnnn), followed by the letter “Z,” followed by a zero-padded sequence number (ddd)  \nIn case generating this file naming scheme presents problems, an alternative acceptable solution would be to provide us with a set of files and a lookup-table mapping the file names delivered into the file names in our requested format described above.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## SciX Curation Model\nThe SciX curation model is described in [Kurtz et al. 2021](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2021BAAS...53d.470K/abstract).\nThe Core Collection consists of the main journals for the disciplines covered, the most influential journals. For ADS, this includes astronomy, astrophysics, and closely related fields. As we move into the inner and outer rings, curation efforts decrease. A qualitative characterization of the model is given below.\n### Core: main journals for discipline\n  * Complete, authoritative coverage of the literature\n  * High-level data products and software indexed\n  * Links to datasets and archives\n\n\n### Inner Ring: closely related disciplines\n  * Most refereed journals covered\n  * Some conf proceedings, some gray literature\n  * Citation and fulltext coverage incomplete\n\n\n### Outer Ring: connected to inner content\n  * Incomplete coverage of the literature because outside of disciplinary scope\n  * Includes content from multidisciplinary journals (e.g. Nature) or repositories (arXiv)\n  * No curation applied other than basic error corrections\n\n\nHow do we determine which journals go in which section? Once the Core Collection has been populated, appropriate journals for the Inner and Outer Rings can be determined as indicated in the diagram above. Up to now, journal selection for the Core Collection has been heuristic, based on qualitative arguments and domain knowledge. We felt it was important to formulate selection criteria based on quantitative arguments. These quantitative selection criteria are unavoidably based on journal metrics and just like any metric, journal metrics are not without controversy. We have settled on the so-called [Journal Eigenfactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfactor) as the main indicator for journal importance. More details on how this metric was used to determine the journal selection for the Core Collection can be found in [this blog](https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/curation-model).\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

A title, author list, and page number are required. Other information such as author affiliation, links to online full-text, abstract text and references are strongly recommended as well. The more information that you can provide for each article, the better. This additional information will aid in searching and using advanced features in SciX.\nThis information can be submitted via email to help@scixplorer.org or placed on our anonymous ftp site, under <ftp://adsftp.harvard.edu/pub/Conf>. Please send us an email indicating when you have transferred things to us, so that we can include it in our database as soon as possible.\n## Including Full-text Papers in SciX\nIt is possible for us to make the full-text of articles published in conference proceedings available via SciX Article Service. This section describes the requirements and procedures to be followed in order to do that.\n**Note** : We do **not** publish original material that is not published elsewhere, since we are not a publisher.\nProvide written permission from the copyright holder allowing SciX to publish electronically the papers in the conference proceedings. The relevant letter should state something along the following lines:\n```\nThe <full description of the copyright holder> grants permission to the Astrophysics Data System at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to:\n\n1. Convert postscript files to tiff files for <name of conference>\n\n2. Add a note at the bottom of each page with the following content:\n\n    (©) <name of copyright holder> - Provided by the Astrophysics Data System\n\n3. Make the images of the articles electronically available, free of charge, for all volumes starting 1 year after publication\n\n```\n\nFeel free to modify as you see fit, especially item three, then send a copy of a signed copy of the permission letter to:\n```\n    Alberto Accomazzi\n    Astrophysics Data System\n    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n    60 Garden Street, M.S. 83\n    Cambridge, MA 02138\n    USA\n\n```\n\nSend us either a printed copy of the conference proceedings book or (if available) the set of full-text files used to create the proceedings. If only a printed book is available, please send it to Alberto Accomazzi at the address listed above along with the permission letter. If full-text PostScript or PDF files are available for all papers, please read on.\nTo submit the full-text files with the necessary information for us to process them, you will need to create a tar or zip archive and transfer it to our ftp server. This is what must be included in the archive file:\n  * All the files containing the full-text, including front-matter (introductory) and back-matter (index) pages if available. You should make sure that these files are either in PostScript or PDF format, and that they have been created using 600dpi or higher resolution fonts. (Note: if you are using `dvips` to create the postscript file, you can specify the options `-D600 -Z` on the command-line to have 600dpi fonts included).\n  * A file named README, containing general information concerning this publication, the name and email address of the person submitting the full-text papers to us, and any additional information we should be aware of.\n  * A file named PUBLICATION, containing the full name of the conference or book (you should use the same name given in the journal field above).\n  * A file named COPYRIGHT, containing the copyright string that needs to be displayed at the bottom of each page that SciX creates and places online in its article service (please do not try to include the copyright symbol © since we already do this for you).\n  * A file named BIBSTEM, containing the bibliographic abbreviation for the publication (e.g. _ASPC..117_ or _2000immm.proc_). This should be the same abbreviation that has been used to create the bibliographic entries described above.\n  * Optionally, a PAGEMAP file containing mapping of full-text file names to page numbers, if these cannot be determined from the full-text files themselves. Whether or not this is needed is a function of how the files were originally created; usually if you used LaTeX and dvips to create the postscript files then the page numbering displayed on each page is carried into the postscript files and can be automatically extracted at least for “regular” pages. Pages which are part of the front-matter may need to have entries associated with them. The format of the PAGEMAP file is the following:\n```\n      # This is a comment\n      file1.ps    C1-C4         # first file has cover pages 1-4\n      file2.ps    C6            # second file has cover page 6\n      file3.ps    1-8 8A 9-15   # third file has pages 1-8, insert 8A, 9-15\n      file4.pdf   16-           # fourth file has pages 16 and up\n\n```\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, please contact us for help.\nCreate a compressed tar or zip archive containing of all the full-text files, the README file, and name of the file using (if possible) the standard acronym adopted by SciX in naming bibliographic entries for the conference. For example, the archive file containing papers submitted to the ASP Conference Proceedings n.117 should be named _ASPC117.tar.gz_ or _ASPC..117.tar.gz_. The archive for files containing the conference _2000immm.proc_ should be named _2000immm.proc.tar.gz_.\nDeposit the tar archive on our anonymous ftp server under the URL ftp://adsftp.harvard.edu/pub/Conf and notify us. We will contact you with any questions regarding the full-text processing of the files.\n## Archiving Conference Proceedings in SciX\nAs more conferences are published electronically, editors are turning to SciX for long-term archiving of their full text proceedings. We can agree to this under the following conditions:\n  * The conference is originally published elswhere (e.g. through a university or observatory publication, or through another publisher).\n  * We receive the pdf or postscript files as described above.\n  * The data have been published at least three years ago.\n\n\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## Data & Curation Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n[General](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/data-faq#general) • [arXiv](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/data-faq#arxiv) • [Refereed status](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/data-faq#refereed-status) • [Submissions](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/data-faq#submissions)\n## General\n##### Q: How often do new articles get added to the database?\nThis depends on the source. We ingest from arXiv daily; from astronomy journals and other sources weekly, over the weekend; and from physics journals and other sources about once every 3 weeks, also over a weekend.\n##### Q: How do I submit missing articles or corrections to an existing article? Missing references?\n  * [Missing articles/corrections to existing article](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/missingrecord)\n\n\nNote that these forms do not work if you’re using the basic HTML version of SciX, and occasionally, some users encounter errors when submitting these forms; email us if you run into issues.\n##### Q: My paper is visible at the publisher but not in SciX yet.\nPublished articles are added to the database at regular intervals; see the publishing schedule above. In addition, for most journals, we do not add the article until it has a published volume and page number. While we appreciate the early access versions, we have found that matching them after the fact and tracking all citations correctly is difficult to do correctly.\nIf sufficient time has passed since the publication date and the article is still unavailable, it may be in a journal we don’t index by default. It’s also possible that the article has been added, but is not appearing the expected collection (astronomy or physics); this is generally the case if the article appears in a general science journal (Nature, Science) where we need keyword information to assign it to a specific collection. Finally, in rare cases deliveries from publishers are missing some articles. If you believe your article should be in the database already, email us for help.\n##### Q: What are bibliographic groups (bib groups)? These appear in a left-side filter.\nBibliographic groups are hand curated by librarians and/or curators at various institutions and generally contain a list of publications produced by researchers at a given institution or using specific telescope(s). If you’re a librarian or curator interested in curating a publicly available collection, email us.\n##### Q: My name is incorrect in an SciX record.\nWe receive author names and other metadata directly from the publisher. First check that your name is correct on the published article; if it isn’t, first contact the publisher directly to fix it with them. However, if your name is correct with the publisher and wrong in the SciX database, [fill out this form](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/missingrecord) and we’ll correct it.\n##### Q: My name has changed since I first started publishing. How can I ensure people find all of my papers when searching for my name?\nWe offer three options; one or more of these may suit your needs. Email us for help deciding which option(s) are best for you and for making any necessary updates:\n  * We maintain a list of author synonyms, so searches for one author name return results for both names. Let us know all of the names you’ve published under to have your names added to this list. (Note that common name variations, such as publishing under your entire first name vs. just an initial, are already included in searches.)\n  * You may also consider [registering for an ORCID ID](https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/orcid-claims) and using that to maintain a personal bibliography.\n  * If you’d prefer that previous names not be visible in SciX, we can modify our searchable metadata on papers published under the previous name(s) to reflect your current name. With this option, all pages within SciX (e.g. search results, paper abstract pages) will reflect the new name; note, however, that we cannot modify external data and links, such as publisher-provided PDFs.\n\n\nFor more information, see our [name change policy](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/policies-scix/name-changes).\n##### Q: What journals and other material do you index?\nComplete lists of the journals, conferences, and other sources we index may be found [here](https://scixplorer.org/journalsdb).\n##### Q: What papers do you have the full text for?\nIn general, we have searchable full text for most major journals in astronomy and physics, especially recent volumes. This includes articles in the arXiv.\n##### Q: How do I get my conference proceeding in SciX?\nFull instructions for submitting conference proceedings can be found [here](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/conf_proc).\n##### Q: Why is my citation count different on other platforms?\nWhile we do our best to capture citations accurately, there are a few reasons we would have more or fewer citations than you may see on other platforms. The primary reasons are as follows:\n  * We merge the arXiv record with the published record, so that a citation for either version counts as one citation. This avoids double counting a citation.\n  * Citations to books, book chapters, and other less formally structured content is often difficult to resolve in an automated fashion. Our citations to this content is likely under-counted.\n  * In order for a citation to count in our system, both the cited record and the citing record must be in our system. Users are always welcome to submit missing content through the [Missing articles](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/missingrecord) form linked off our feedback menu.\n\n\n## arXiv\n##### Q: My arXiv paper is missing its references.\nWe extract references directly from the PDF for arXiv records, which doesn’t always work well, depending on reference and document format. If the paper will be published, we will get the reference list from the publisher and will update the references on the record at that point. Note also that we’re working on a new module for extracting references directly from PDFs and arXiv reference extraction should improve at that point.\n##### Q: My arXiv paper had some citations before it was published. Will these be lost once the published version is out?\nWe automatically merge the arXiv and published versions of papers, including citations.\n##### Q: The author list of the arXiv and the published versions of my paper are different. What happens when the two versions are merged?\nAuthor metadata from the published version takes precedence, so arXiv-only coauthors will be removed from the record.\n##### Q: The published version of my paper is out and indexed on SciX, but the arXiv version is listed separately.\nThe published and the arXiv versions of a paper should merge into a single entry automatically. Occasionally that doesn’t work; [let us know](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/associatedarticles) and we’ll fix it.\n##### Q: My name is correct on arXiv but wrong in SciX. How can I fix it?\nSubmit your corrections using [this form](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/missingrecord).\n##### Q: My name is wrong in arXiv, will you fix it?\nYou’ll need to contact the arXiv directly for corrections to your papers on their site.\n## Refereed status\n##### Q: Why is my PhD thesis listed as refereed?\nSciX has decided to list PhD theses as refereed because they go under the review of a thesis committee and are thus “peer reviewed.” However, if you prefer to not see PhD theses appear in your search results, restrict your search results to articles only using the “Publication Type” filter in the left-side column.\n##### Q: A conference proceeding is listed as non-refereed even though it underwent peer review.\nMost conference proceedings are not refereed. They may be reviewed by an editor, but rarely is there the kind of rigorous review as is done by many journals. (In general, users and editors and librarians and publishers all have different opinions on what constitutes “peer-reviewed.”)\nIf a publication or a conference is generally not peer-reviewed, all articles/proceedings within that publication/conference will automatically be listed as non-refereed. If a particular article/proceeding within the generally non-refereed publication/conference is peer-reviewed, have the editors email us to confirm and we can correct the listing.\n## Submissions\n##### Q: How do I submit my PhD thesis?\nSome institutions send us their recent PhD theses directly, though it may take a few months post-defense for us to receive them. However, if your institution does not send us your thesis, you have several options to add it to our database:\n  * [Zenodo Astronomy Thesis](https://zenodo.org/communities/astrothesis) collection: This is an open-source repository of astronomy theses and dissertations which is automatically ingested into SciX roughly once a month. If your thesis is already indexed by SciX but the text is not openly accessible, you can upload a copy of the PDF to make it openly available. This is a good option if you’d like your thesis to be openly available and it’s not currently accessible online.\n  * [SciX submission](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/missingrecord): You can submit your thesis metadata directly to SciX for indexing. If you want the PDF to be linked to the record, it will first need to be hosted somewhere online and then you can provide the URL and other metadata using this form. If the text of your thesis is not already available online and you’d like it to be, consider submitting it to the Zenodo collection.\n\n\n##### Q: My name (or title, etc.) is misspelled on my paper.\nIf it is wrong on the publisher’s website, you’ll need to contact them to correct the error, as we’ve agreed with the publishers to reflect the data they pass on to us.\nIf it’s right on the publisher’s website but wrong on ours, we’re sorry for the error! [Contact us](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/missingrecord) so we can fix it.\n##### Q: How can I get my software package indexed in SciX?\nSoftware records are automatically indexed in SciX once they have a Zenodo record and have been cited at least once. If you’d like to make your software records eligible for indexing in SciX, complete the following steps:\n  1. Upload your software code to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). You can do this directly or by linking to a Github repository. If you link to a Github repository, you can specify a specific release or version, or you can link to the top-level repository to create a non-version-specific record.\n  2. Get the BibTeX (or other bibliographic format) record from Zenodo and cite it in your paper as normal. Your software will not yet be in SciX, so make sure to get the citation information from Zenodo.\n  3. Once your paper has been published and is indexed in SciX, the system will recognize that the bibliography contains a software record and will automatically create a corresponding software record in the SciX database. The publisher will be listed as Zenodo and the bibstem (the abbreviation that appears in the bibcode) will be [zndo](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=bibstem%3A%22zndo%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0). The publication type for these records is [software](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=doctype%3Asoftware&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).\n\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n  * Zenodo allows you to create different records for different versions of your software, which generally correspond to different releases in Github. This can be beneficial if the software has changed substantially with time, or if different authors have worked on different versions of the code and need to be acknowledged as appropriate. SciX will index each Zenodo version of your software separately, as long as each has citations. Currently, citations are counted for each version separately, but eventually it will be possible to see all citations for all versions of a software package in one record in SciX.\n  * The [Astrophysics Source Code Library](http://ascl.net) indexes astronomy-related software that has been used in a publication. SciX indexes these ASCL records (bibstem: [ascl](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=bibstem%3A%22ascl%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0), publication type: [software](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=doctype%3Asoftware&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)) and they can collect citations similarly to the process above. One difference between the two processes is that ASCL indexes only the non-version-specific record while Zenodo indexes each version separately. It is possible for a given software package to be in both Zenodo and ASCL, if they fit the necessary criteria for each.\n\n\n##### Q: I submitted some ORCID claims but they don’t show up when I search by my ORCID ID.\nThese can take up to 24 hours to index. Please contact us if they aren’t showing up after this time.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## Journal Inclusion\n## How do you evaluate journals for inclusion?\nThe SciX evaluates all journals for coverage using the criteria listed below. We seek comprehensive, but not all-inclusive, coverage of the field of astronomy, and we take into consideration relevancy of content, standards of presentation, and regularity of publication. We evaluate journals on an ongoing basis and add or delete journals regularly. SciX reserves the right to exclude content deemed inappropriate for its collection or inconsistent with its editorial policies. To be accepted for coverage, a journal must:\n  * Be relevant to astronomy\n  * Be of a quality and scope of interest to an international audience\n  * Have an ISSN\n  * Be registered with CrossRef\n  * Follow standard conventions for scholarly journals\n  * Have an informative title and descriptive article titles\n  * Include full addresses for authors\n  * Include abstracts and key words\n  * Include references that are current, from quality journals, and of an appropriate number for the article in a standard format\n  * Contain usable metadata including: abstracts, titles, and keywords\n  * Demonstrate diversity of reviewers and authors\n  * Include all or mostly all original articles\n  * Contain articles that are substantiated with empirical data or other means\n  * Be published on a regular schedule appropriate for the established frequency of the journal\n  * Have articles that are written by professionals in their field.\n\n\nIn addition, e-journals must:\n  * Provide evidence of archiving arrangements, online or otherwise\n  * Include a posting date for articles and revisions\n  * Have published at least three issues\n\n\nFeatures that support acceptance:\n  * Sponsorship by a astronomy or physics association or other society\n  * Astronomers or physicists among editorial board members and authors\n  * Indexed in other scholarly databases\n  * Online access\n  * English table of contents\n  * Transliterated references\n  * Frequency of publication clearly advertised on masthead or web page\n\n\nFor e-journals\n  * Presence of version number\n  * Indication of where previous versions can be obtained Links\n\n\nRelevance: An article that includes any of the following may be relevant:\n  * the scientific study of astronomy\n  * content in any of the subfields of astronomy or physics\n  * non-astronomy content of interest to astronomers in different subfields\n  * content in related fields that has astronomical relevance\n\n\nIf you have a journal to be evaluated, please feel free to send email to us at help@scixplorer.org.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

All entries should be in ascii and there should be no tabs or control characters. Blank lines can delimit paragraphs in the abstract, but should not otherwise be present within a record. The bibliographic code is the only field which is required for all records, but author list, journal name, publication date, and title are strongly recommended as well. Additional records should be separated by a blank line.\n## Fields in the Tagged Format\nDetailed descriptions of each field follow.\n### Bibliographic Code\nThe bibliographic code is a 19 digit code (see [Bibcodes](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix/bibcode))\n### Author List\nThe author list should contain semi-colon separated authors listed with last name first, followed by first name or initials. A paper with one author would be listed as Minkowski, R. A paper with multiple authors would be listed as\n```\nNeubauer, F. J.; Burwell, C. G.; Miller, W. C.\n\n```\n\nAuthors whose names contain “Jr” or “III” should be entered as\n```\nRoberts, L. C., Jr.\n\n```\n\n### Review Authors\nThis contains the review authors in the same format as the regular authors.\n### Book Authors\nThis contains the book authors in the same format as the regular authors.\n### Author Affiliation\nThe institution with which the author is affiliated. If more than one author affiliation is to be listed, here is the suggested format:\n```\nAA(first author's institution) AB(second author's institution) ...\n\n```\n\nEmail addresses can be specified in the author affiliations. Please mark them as follows:\n```\n<EMAIL>email address</EMAIL>\n\n```\n\n### Journal Name\nThis entry contains the reference information, including the journal name, volume, and page range. Also include here any editors of books or conference proceedings.\n### Publication Date\nThis contains the publication month and year of the article in the format MM/YYYY (i.e. 02/1995). If no publication month is known, please use a month of 00.\n### First Page of Article\nThis contains the first page number of the article.\n### Last Page of Article\nThis contains the last page number of the article.\n### Title\n%T contains the title of the article. If there is also an original language title, it can be submitted with a %t and the language included in the %M tag.\n### Object Name\nThis contains the name of Objects described in the paper. These are normally handled through SIMBAD and are therefore not part of the user input except in special circumstances.\n### Origin of the Article in SciX\nThis contains the source of the record in SciX.\n### Abstract Copyright\nThis contains a copyright statement of the abstract, such as (C) 1990: American Astromomical Society\n### Unified Astronomy Thesaurus keywords\nThis contains keywords from the [Unified Astronomy Thesaurus](http://astrothesaurus.org/) (UAT), separated by a comma.\n### Links to Other Information\nLinks should be preceded by their link type and semi-colon separated, e.g.\n```\n%I DOI: 10.1234/article_doi; PDF: https://article_pdf\n\n```\n\nAvailable links include arxiv, data, doi, electr, pdf and other.\n### Keywords\nThis contains keywords related to the article, separated by a comma.\n### Language\nThis contains the original language of the article.\n### Comment\nThis contains author comments.\n### Collection\nThis contains the database key if you are submitting abstracts for multiple databases (astronomy: AST, physics: PHY, general: GEN).\n### Abstract\nThis contains the abstract text. Any line beginning with at least one blank space will be assumed to be a new paragraph. New paragraphs may also be delimited with blank lines. Abstracts should not contain tables, and will appear best in the system if they contain only ascii characters.\n### References\nThis field should contain the list of references cited by the current paper. They should be formatted so that there is just one reference per line, e.g.:\n```\n%Z Bechtold,~J., \\etal 1994, \\aj, 108, 374\n   Massa, D. L., & Savage, B. D. 1984, ApJ, 279, 310\n   Savage, B.

We show that the masses of intracluster plasma emitting in the X-ray band are to decrease more rapidly. We also show that consideration of the intrinsic spread in the dynamical formation times leads us to predict more numerous faint sources at given dynamical mass. The model we compute yields steeper luminosity functions in the X-ray band with a specific change in lookback time: the bright end shifts back. Such negative evolution is fast even at modest redshifts z less than about 0.5 if the external gas infalling into groups of clusters was preheated and has cooled down after z of about 1.5-2. If so, the evolution is considerably faster in the X-ray than in the optical band, comparing interestingly with data from the existing surveys.\n%Z Abell, Ci. 0. 1958, ApJS, 3, 211\nBarcons, X., Fabian, A.

W.\n%F AA(Max-Planck-Institut fuer Astronomie, Koenigstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany)\n%P 13\n%B We discuss various interpretations of the nature of extremely red objects (EROs), discovered in the first of 7 deep, wide-field K' images in the CADIS survey. Point sources with K' = 20.5 mag are detected at the 5 sigma level over an area of 125 arcmin^2. A total of 20 EROs meeting the selection criteria (R-K') >= 6^{m} and K' <= 19.75 mag were selected from the data, giving a surface density of 0.16 +/- 0.04 arcmin^{-2} for all EROs and 0.016 +/- 0.011 arcmin^{-2} for bright (K' < 19^{m}) EROs.} \n\n```\n\nExample 4:\n```\n%T Chandra observations of M31 and their implications for its ISM\n%A Primini, F., Garcia, M., Murray, S., Forman, W., Jones, C., and McClintock, J.\n%F AA(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA), AB(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA), AC(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA), AD(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA), AE(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA), AF(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA) \n%B We have been regularly observing the bulge and inner disk of M31 for nearly one year, using both the HRC-I and ACIS-I instruments on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. We present results from our program that are of interest to the study of the ISM in M31. In particular, we find that the unresolved emission within 3' of the center of M31 has a distinctly softer spectrum than that of most of the resolved X-ray sources in the region. Preliminary spectral analysis of bright point sources in the bulge shows no evidence (within the poor statistics) for soft spectral components, but does reveal significant extra-galactic X-ray extinction (NH ~ 1021 cm-2). We find no new X-ray counterparts to supernova remnants to date. \n\n```\n\nExample 5:\n```\n%T We Do Not Forget Johannes Kepler\n%A Wszołek, B\n%B Year 2009 was announced as the International Year of Astronomy. This was to mark 400th anniversary of the first astronomical observation through a telescope by Galileo. From the other hand, this year marks 400th anniversary of Astronomia Nova, the famous work of Kepler published in Prague in 1609. Two laws of planetary motions opened human efforts to understand gravitational force; so the overall cosmic space conquest, with its great importance not only for astronomy, was developed thankful to Kepler's work. This contribution is thought to show the most inspiring ideas of Johannes Kepler, published in Astronomia Nova and in other his books. \n%I PDF: FILE:proc16_02.pdf\n\n```\n\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n[Searching](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/faq-scix/#searching) • [SciX Libraries](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/faq-scix/#scix-libraries) • [ORCID](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/faq-scix/#orcid) • [Data and Curation](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/faq-scix/#data-and-curation) • [Database Coverage](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/faq-scix/#database-coverage) • [Other](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/faq-scix/#other)\n## Searching\n##### Q: Typing a fielded query for an author query (e.g. author:”huchra, j.” or author:”^huchra, j.”) or clicking on the search term dropdown is a lot of work.\nThere are two options. First, a first-author query can usually be entered as _^huchra, j._ —the _author:_ tag is not necessary for first-author searches (note, though, that this format does not work well for authors with multi-part last names). Second, many search tags will autocomplete in the search box. Begin typing the search tag, such as _author:_ , and either press the return key or the right arrow key when the tag autocompletes to accept it.\n##### Q: Is it possible to search using the second author of a paper?\nPositional searches are supported. To search for a second author, use _pos(author:”huchra,j.”,2)_. See the Help page for [positional field searches](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/positional) for more info.\n##### Q: How do I exclude a term from my search?\nEither prepend a negative sign (e.g. _-doctype:”proposal”_) or use the Boolean operator NOT (e.g. _NOT doctype:”proposal”_) while searching. See the Help page for [Boolean queries](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-syntax#combining-search-terms-to-make-a-compound-query) for more info, paying special attention to the note on when differences in behavior between NOT and the negative sign may arise.\n##### Q: Records are missed when searching from the 1st of one month to the end of the current month, e.g. pubdate:[2016-01-01 TO 2016-06-30].\nRecords do not generally have a publication day, just a month and year. The missing day is set to 00 (e.g. January 2016 is set to 2016-01-00). Searches starting on the 1st of a given month will exclude all records with publication days of 00. It is preferable to not use a day when searching over a publication date range; specifying only a month will include records with publication days of 00. This is similarly true for the small number of records missing publication months. Searches beginning in January of a given year may miss records with publication months of 00. To search for records from the first half of the year, employ a search term such as _pubdate:[2016 TO 2016-06]_.\n##### Q: How can I search for an acronym that is the same as a common word?\nSciX treats search terms entered in all caps as acronyms and will only return records that contain the all caps acronym form, not the lowercase common word form. In addition, some acronyms will auto-expand in the search (e.g. searching for “ADS” will find both “ADS” and “Astrophysics Data System” but will ignore “ads”).\n##### Q: My new paper is not appearing in SciX.\nNew papers appearing on arXiv are ingested daily, though there may be a delay of one day for them to appear in the new SciX. Published articles are ingested as the publisher provides them on a weekly basis, generally over the weekend.\n##### Q: Searching for an author’s name plus their affiliation doesn’t give a complete list of results.\nNot all publishers provide authors’ affiliations for search indexing, even if the affiliations are listed in the PDF or HTML form of the article itself. Also, note that searching using the _aff:_ search tag searches the raw affiliation text provided by the publisher, such that searching for “Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics” or for “CfA” will give different results. Use the _inst:_ search tag to search the canonical affiliations; more information is available on the [Search Syntax help page](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-syntax).\n##### Q: How do I build a URL using a known identifier of a paper?\nYou can access the abstract page of a known paper by inserting an identifier (bibcode, DOI, arXiv ID) into a URL, following a set pattern. The base URL is `https://scixplorer.org/abs/<identifier>`, where `<identifier>` can be one of the following:\n  * bibcode, e.g. [https://scixplorer.org/abs/2008ApJ…689.1044G](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2008ApJ...689.1044G)\n  * DOI, e.g. <https://scixplorer.org/abs/10.1086/592738>\n  * arXiv ID in two ways, e.g.: \n    * <https://scixplorer.org/abs/arXiv:0808.2870>\n    * <https://scixplorer.org/abs/0808.2870>\n\n\n##### Q: I have some links to Classic pages on my website - do I need to update all of these to the new SciX links?\nNope! Existing Classic URLs now redirect to the corresponding URLs in the new SciX.\n##### Q: Where do I find the utility **_Get citation lists for selected articles_** and similar second order queries?\nIn general, the function **Reviews** in the **Explore** menu will generate the same list of publications as selecting all records in Classic and clicking on the button _Get citation lists for selected articles_. The only difference is the fact that the new SciX does not show the frequency, but the results are sorted by the number of cites to the original set (when sorted by score).\nThe new function **Useful** can be used in a similar way to generate the same results you would get the with button _Get reference lists for selected articles_ in the old SciX. When “score” is selected for sorting, the records are sorted by the number of cites by the original set.\nThe **Co-reads** function corresponds with _Get also-read lists for selected articles_.\n## SciX Libraries\n##### Q: The number of papers listed in the header of my library differs from the actual number in the library.\nWhen you create or update your library, the bibcodes of the new records are stored in a database. Currently this list does not get updated when records are merged or deleted within the SciX index, rather these changes get reflected at display time of the contents of an SciX Library.\n## ORCID\n##### Q: I just claimed some papers using my ORCID ID but they’re not showing up in the public search.\nORCID claims can take up to 24 hours to be processed and approved in our system. Please check the search again tomorrow.\n##### Q: I have records on my ORCID profile that do not appear in SciX.\nFirst, if you haven’t yet, you’ll need to log into ORCID in SciX, using the ORCID dropdown menu in the top bar. If you’ve published under multiple names, you’ll need to enter these on your [ORCID settings page](https://scixplorer.org/user/settings/orcid). Papers on your ORCID profile also need to exist in SciX and need to have an identifier we recognize (generally a bibcode, arXiv ID, or DOI). Finally, if you’ve recently entered or updated these records, note that it can take up to 24 hours for them to be registered in our system.\n## Data and Curation\nFor data and curation questions, see our [data and curation FAQs](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/data-faq).\n## Database Coverage\n##### Q: How complete is SciX?\nSciX aims to be a comprehensive source for scientific literature. This includes published refereed articles and arXiv e-prints, as well as conference proceedings, books, and other scholarly works. We aim to not only index these resources but also enrich them with links to data or other resources when available. If a record is missing, please let us know via our [Submit Abstract Form](https://scixplorer.org/feedback/correctabstract).\n##### Q: Why are citations from an arXiv record missing? Why is an arXiv record missing its references?\nFor arXiv sources, we attempt to extract references from the full text and from there create citations. However, as papers can be submitted to the arXiv with a bibliography in a non-standard format, this process is not always successful. When the published version of an arXiv paper becomes available, we will use the publisher-provided reference list and disregard the arXiv reference list.\n##### Q: For how many records is the full text available for searching?\nThe full text is available for searching for many records, including most recent publications. You can search for records with full text using the query [has:body](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=has:body). Note that the searchable full text resides in our database and is separate from the links to publisher or arXiv sources; not all records with source links have searchable full text.\n## Other\n##### Q: What internet browsers are supported by SciX?\nWe support all current versions (within the last 5 years) of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We also support Internet Explorer 11. This includes Firefox ESR (extended service release) versions, but does not include versions of any browser newer than 5 years old that have been officially retired.\n##### Q: How should I acknowledge SciX?\nIf you wish to acknowledge us in a publication, kindly use a phrase such as the following: “This research has made use of SciX, a scientific literature search and discovery platform.” If you are using SciX as a tool for bibliometric studies, please make sure you have an in-depth understanding of the system, its features and limitations, by reading and citing as appropriate the relevant published literature about SciX ([refereed](https://scixplorer.org/public-libraries/aI9-ox_2RNeZK-gm-4DpVQ), [non-refereed](https://scixplorer.org/public-libraries/iETdWs2pSGajhFBI30X3UQ)).\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

If your library provides online linking services, and if it has provided the relevant information to SciX, all you have to do is select the proper entry in your preferences under [Library Link Server](https://scixplorer.org/user/settings/librarylink). If you find an entry for your institute, select it and click on the **Apply** button. If not, please contact your electronic resources librarian and request that they email the information about your institute’s OpenURL server to us, at help@scixplorer.org, so that we can include this in our menu selection.\nOnce you have selected your _Library Link Server_ , you can go back and search SciX as usual. Whenever viewing a record for a paper which has full-text content available online from a publisher, you will notice that a new link named “**My institution** ” will appear. Following the link will take you to your library’s link resolver, which will give you a list of options available to you for obtaining the full-text content. Please note that the availability of a library link in SciX does not necessarily mean that the full-text content will be available to you, as this determination is done by your _Library Link Server_.

    "title": "mySciX Email Notifications",
    "section": "",
    "subsection": "What's New",
    "content": "## mySciX Email Notifications\nThe mySciX notification service delivers daily or weekly email updates based on your designated keywords or searches.\n## Setup\nThere are 5 types of notifications you can create: arXiv, citations, authors, keywords, and general. The first 4 are roughly equivalent to their counterparts in Classic, as described below. The fifth, the general notification type, is new and is designed to allow for more flexibility in creating and generating notifications.\nTo create a new notification (for all notifications except for the general notifications), go to the [mySciX settings page](https://scixplorer.org/user/notifications) and click the **Create** button. Choose your notification type from the menu on the next screen, then follow directions for your chosen notification type as given below.\n### arXiv\nThe arXiv notifications are designed as a replacement to the daily arXiv emails generated by Classic. They are generated daily on weekdays and notify you of all new papers in a selected set of arXiv categories or sub-categories. Optionally, you can also specify keywords to be notified of any new papers that match those keywords in your designated categories. During setup, you’ll be asked to select your arXiv categories and specify any keywords, as desired.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/help/img/myads_arxiv.png)\n  \n\nThings to note during setup:\n  * You can choose to receive notifications for either a top-level category, such as astro-ph, or for individual sub-categories, such as astro-ph.CO\n  * To search for keywords in specific fields, use search tags such as _title:_. If no search tags are specified, given keywords will be searched for in all paper metadata (author, title, abstract)\n  * If multiple keywords are given, by default the search assumes all keywords are necessary for a match. This can be overridden by explicitly combining multiple keywords with OR. Other operators, such as AND, NOT, plus (+), and minus (-) are also allowed, as in regular searching\n  * All papers from the designated arXiv categories that day are shown in the email notification, so if many categories are selected, the daily email can grow quite large\n\n\n### Citations\nThe citations notifications provide a list of papers citing the articles written by a person, typically you; they are similar to the Classic SciX “citations” list. They are generated weekly over the weekend and notify you of up to 5 papers that cite work by you or another specified author. Only new citations are shown.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/help/img/myads_citations.png)\n  \n\nThings to note during setup:\n  * During setup, you can provide multiple name variations and/or your ORCID ID to identify your papers. Notifications include any papers added since the last update citing work by any of the given author name(s) or ORCID IDs\n  * Weekly emails are condensed into a single email that queries all collections. If your papers cannot be uniquely specified via your name or name variations, consider setting up an ORCID ID and claiming the papers you wish to receive citations notifications for. Alternatively, you can set up a general notification that includes the desired collection. The syntax for this would be, for example, _citations(author:”Huchra, J.”) collection:astronomy_\n\n\n### Authors\nThe authors notifications are generated weekly over the weekend and notify you of up to 5 new papers by any of the given authors. Only papers added since the last update will be shown. The setup interface is similar to that of the citations notifications and either author names or ORCID IDs can be provided. Use name variations or ORCID IDs to disambiguate, or set up a general notification that includes the desired collection.\n### Keywords\nThe keywords notifications are generated weekly over the weekend and notify you of newly added papers about a given set of keywords or other query. Three queries are constructed for the given search term(s): recent papers, trending papers, and useful papers. Recent papers shows the 5 most recent papers matching the given query, while trending papers shows the 5 papers that best match the query _[trending](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/second-order)(query)_. Useful papers shows the 5 papers that best match the query _[useful](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/second-order)(query)_.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/help/img/myads_keywords.png)\n  \n\nThings to note during setup:\n  * Search tags, such as _title:_ , can be used with query terms, as in a regular search. If no search tags are given, all metadata is searched for a given search term, as in a regular search\n  * If multiple keywords are given, by default the search assumes all keywords are necessary for a match. This can be overridden by explicitly combining multiple keywords with OR. Other operators, such as AND, NOT, plus (+), and minus (-) are also allowed, as in regular searching\n\n\n### General\nThe general notifications are new and did not have an equivalent in the Classic notification system. They allow users to create a notification out of almost any SciX query. To set one up, execute a search that you’d like to receive notifications for, including any desired filters from the left sidebar. On the search results page, click the bell/notification icon above the search results.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/help/img/myads_general.png)\n  \n\nEnter a query name, which will be displayed in the main listing of mySciX notifications and in the mySciX emails, and choose a daily or weekly notifications schedule. Note that currently only new arXiv listings are added daily, while other new articles are added on a weekly basis. For most queries, you’ll be notified of the latest papers matching the query. However, for queries that include an operator, such as _trending()_ , you’ll be notified of papers that best match the query terms.\n## Editing\nIf you’ve created or imported notifications, you can edit them from the [mySciX settings page](https://scixplorer.org/user/notifications). Top-level settings can be changed directly from this page, using the Actions menu associated with each notification. Available actions include:\n  * Preview: select to run the query and display the results in the search results page. For time-sensitive queries, such as daily arXiv notifications, the query will be run as it would if notifications were generated today. If more than one query is generated for a given notification, such as a keywords notification, all notifications will be listed in a submenu\n  * Disable/Enable: select to disable or enable email notifications. If disabled, the setup will remain in your settings but email notifications will not be sent. Disabled notifications appear greyed out in the main notification listing\n  * Edit: select to view and edit the detail-level settings for a given notification\n  * Delete: select to delete a notification from your list. Note that this action cannot be reversed\n\n\nDetail-level settings, accessed via the Edit button as described above, are displayed on a screen similar to the initial setup screen for each notification type. The initial setup, including keywords or author names, can be edited here. In addition, for all notification types except the general notification type, query names are generated automatically upon creation. The name, which appears on the mySciX settings page and on the generated email notifications, can be edited after creation here on the detail-level settings page for all notification types.\n**Note for general-type notifications** : General-type notifications cannot be edited. To easily alter your general-type notification, click “Search” in the Actions menu, which will run the search as it would in today’s notification email. Remove the _entdate:_ and _pubdate:_ search tags from the end of the search, then make any other edits as desired to the search terms. Use the “Create email notification” widget in the right sidebar to create a new general-type notification using the new search. You may delete the old notification once the new, edited notification has been created.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

More advanced information on searching can be found in the[Search Syntax help page](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/search-syntax) and other pages in the “Making a Query” and “Search Results” sections._\nFinding a paper by an author with a common name, especially if you have little else to go on, can be like finding a needle in a haystack. However, there are some strategies that can help.\n### Exact name matching\nBy default, SciX returns all relevant matches when searching for author names. For example, searching for _author:”smith, j”_ will return results for J. Smith, Jane Smith, and John Smith, amongst others. To disable this synonym expansion, use the equals sign operator (=). Searching for _=author:”smith, j”_ will only return results where the first initial was used in place of the full spelled-out given name.\n### Filtering results\nThe facets are useful when trying to narrow down a large list of search results. In addition to the author facet, which allows you to include or exclude name variations of authors, try these facets. All are located in the left-hand column, unless otherwise noted:\n  * Collections: by default, records from all database collections (astronomy, physics, and general) are searched from the one-box modern search interface. Limit or exclude collections here as necessary\n  * Refereed: limit your search to refereed or non-refereed records\n  * Years: located in the right-hand column, the year sliders allow you to select a publication year or range of publication years to include or exclude\n  * Publications: if the journal or other publication name is known, select it here\n  * Bib Groups: some telescopes and research institutes maintain curated listings of records relevant to their institutions; these groupings are listed here\n  * Data: filter based on the availability of specific links to data products, such as NASA missions, archives, SIMBAD, and NED\n  * SIMBAD and NED Objects: filter based on a specific object\n\n\n### I’m an author with a common name; how do I make my papers easier to find?\nIf you’re an author with a common name, there are some strategies you can follow to make your papers more discoverable.\n### Tips & Tricks\n  * Include your full name and at least your middle initial in author lists.\n  * If possible, use the same form of your name (e.g. initial vs. spelled-out form of your given or middle names) when publishing.\n  * If you’ve changed your name (given or family name) since you’ve begun publishing, email us at help@scixplorer.org and we can link your name variations together. Thereafter, searching for one name variation will return publications under all linked names.\n\n\n### ORCID\nCreate an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/). After obtaining your ID, [claim your papers in SciX](https://scixplorer.org/orcid-scix/claiming-papers). We’ll do some basic checks to make sure you haven’t claimed someone else’s papers by mistake and link your ORCID ID to your papers within 24 hours. As part of this process, the papers you claim within SciX will automatically be pushed to your ORCID record on [orcid.org](https://orcid.org/). For current and future publications, many journals (such as ApJ) now accept ORCID IDs upon submission; ORCID IDs submitted this way will automatically populate in SciX after paper publication.\nAfter linking your ORCID ID with your publications, users will be able to search for your papers using the syntax _orcid:XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX_. You may link to the search results using this syntax: https://scixplorer.org/search?q=orcid%3AXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX\n### Public library\nIn some situations, [creating a library](https://scixplorer.org/libraries-scix/creating-libraries), [making it public](https://scixplorer.org/libraries-scix/public-libraries), and sharing the link may be useful.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

How do you make sure you’ve covered everything and are fully up to speed on your background reading? SciX has some tools to help. We’ve divided this quick start guide into three sections, depending on the starting point: starting from an individual paper, from a broad topic or keyword, or from an existing library. Read on for more.\n### Starting from an individual paper\nIf you have one or two reference or other papers you’re starting your search with, there are a few sources of potentially related papers. To begin, go to the abstract page for the paper. In the left column are links for the Citations, References, and Co-Reads. Citations list papers that cite the given paper, while References are cited in the given paper and listed in its bibliography. Exploring both of these is a good starting point. Also investigate papers listed under Co-Reads. These are papers that users who read the paper in question also read; they may be related to the original paper in a variety of ways and can provide interesting insights. By default, the Citations, References, and Co-Reads lists are sorted in reverse chronological order. To re-sort or filter the results, click the button to view the results in a search results page.\n![an\n   image showing the Co-Reads links on the abstract page](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-coreads_1.gif)\n  \n_Abstract page and Co-Reads for a canonical WMAP paper. Click “view this link in a search results page” to re-sort and filter the related papers._\n### Starting from a topic\nIf you want to know about a general topic (e.g. gravitational waves or coronal mass ejections), there are three main methods to find related papers: sorting, second-order search operators, and the paper network.\n**Sorting**\nThe sort options available from the search results page are a natural first step in exploring by topic. For many searches, the default sort option is by publication date, with most recently published articles first. However, other sorting options may be more useful. For example, a search for _M31_ returns most recently published articles first. Sorting by **citation count** instead returns more highly cited articles first. These results can be narrowed by publication year or by other filters in the left and right columns. For a measure of more recent popularity, try sorting by **read count** : this sorts the results based on the papers most read or downloaded over the last 90 days.\n**Second-order search operators**\nThe [second-order search operators](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/second-order) are usable in the one-box search box and are available as an autocomplete search term in the search box, or for selection from the search term menu above the search box. There are three main second-order search operators that may be useful for literature searches:\n  \n\n\n\n**Paper Network**\nThe [Paper Network](https://scixplorer.org/actions-scix/visualize#paper-network), available from the Explore dropdown menu in the upper right on the search results page, is a useful tool for exploring subtopics within a larger search. Results from a search are sorted into subgroups based on shared references between those records. Clicking on one of the resulting subgroups (the colorful wedges in the visualization) shows the papers belonging to that subgroup. At the end of the list of subgroup papers is a short list of papers that were highly cited by the papers within the given subgroup but that may or may not have been included in the original search. This list of potentially relevant papers is similar to the useful() papers above.\nNote that, by default, the paper network is built from the top 400 papers in a list of results and can only be extended to include up to 1000 papers in the results list. Therefore, it is best used with a list that has been been previously narrowed to a few hundred papers.\n![an\n   image showing Paper Network with suggested papers](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-paper-network-suggested-papers.png)\n  \n_Paper network for a search for refereed papers about the MUSE instrument. In this subgroup, containing instrumentation papers, the suggested papers at the bottom contain highly relevant non-refereed conference proceedings and other papers._\n### Starting from a library\nIf you’ve started to assemble a library organized around a given topic (e.g. for a paper in progress), there are tools available to ensure you haven’t forgotten any relevant references. In addition to the paper suggestions offered by the in-library Paper Network, you can use the Explore menu to discover related papers and add them to your library.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## Getting Started Series\n### Searching for a Specific Paper\n### How do you search for a specific paper?\n_Note: the Getting Started series is designed to get you started with the new interface. More advanced information on searching can be found in the[Search Syntax help page](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/search-syntax) and other pages in the “Making a Query” and “Search Results” sections._\nA common task in SciX is locating a specific paper, often for download or for retrieval of the bibliographic data. In this case, a user usually knows an author name (often the name of the first author), plus a publication year. This type of search is simple, but knowing some tips and tricks can make the process proceed more quickly and smoothly.\n### Tips\n  * Use fielded queries to ensure you receive the expected results.\n  * Use the [Classic Form](https://scixplorer.org/#classic-form) to automatically create fielded queries and replicate the SciX Classic look and feel. (Note: advanced and fulltext search fields are not available in the Classic Form.)\n  * Make use of tag auto-completion when entering fielded queries to speed up search term entry.\n  * It is not generally recommended that you initially search on author affiliation as a number of publishers do not provide this information to SciX. Additionally, variants on institution name may confuse the search results.\n\n\n### Fielded vs. unfielded queries\nThe one-box search field accepts both fielded queries, where the user specifies the field being searched (such as _year:_) along with the search terms, and unfielded queries, where no search fields are explicitly specified. Unfielded queries automatically search all metadata fields; this may not produce the expected results.\nWe recommend that you use the field tags (e.g. _author:_) when searching for a known author and/or year of publication. However, you do not have to type the full tag or select it from the list each time you search. Auto-completion is enabled, so you can start typing the tag, then press Return to accept the auto-complete when the appropriate tag is shown. The cursor will automatically be moved to the appropriate spot within the tag to type the search term.\n### Querying when author and year of publication are known\n  1. Click on the author tag in the Quick Field area, or start typing _author:_ and press Return to accept the auto-completion.\n  2. Fill in the author name.\n  3. Do the same for the year: tag and year of publication.\n  4. Press Return or click the Search button to begin the search.\n\n![a short\n   animated image showing querying by author and year](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-author.gif)\n### Querying when the first author is known\nFollow the same procedure as for a known author, but to trigger the first-author tag autocompletion, use the standard caret (^) operator or start typing “first author.”\nNote: for a first-author search using the ^ operator, you do not have to specify the author tag. Typing _^last_name_ is an abbreviation for _author:”^last_name”_ and will produce the expected results.\n![a short\n   animated image showing querying by first author using the caret operator](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-caret_firstauthor.gif)\n### Filtering\nIf your search by author and/or publication year returns too many results, you can use [interactive filtering](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/filter) to narrow down the results instead of editing your original search query. Filtering by author or publication is often useful when a paper is known.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-filter-facet.png)\n### Building a library and calculating metrics\n### How do you build a library?\n_Note: the Getting Started series is designed to get you started with the new interface. More advanced information on libraries can be found in the[Creating and Editing a Library help page](https://scixplorer.org/libraries-scix/creating-libraries) and other pages in the “SciX Libraries” sections._\nSciX libraries allow you to save collections of papers to view later. These libraries can be private (by default) or public. In addition to viewing and sorting saved papers, you can export the collection in a variety of formats, view citations and other metrics, explore visualizations such as the paper or author networks, and check for related papers. Libraries are a popular way to build reference lists when writing papers, or keeping one’s bibliography to use in a CV.\n**_Note: to save papers to a library, you must be logged into your SciX account._**\nAdd papers to a new or existing library directly from the search results. You can add all papers returned in the search to a library, or only a selection:\n![a short\n   animated image showing adding a paper to a library](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-library-add.gif)\n  \nThe same function is available on the abstract page of a single paper.\n### Export\nThe contents of a library can be [exported in a variety of formats](https://scixplorer.org/actions-scix/export), including BibTeX and AASTeX. This was designed to facilitate the development of a SciX library as a bibliography for a paper in progress, and allow its export into the appropriate format for the journal when ready.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-library-export.gif)\n### Metrics: citations and reads\nThe [citations and read statistics](https://scixplorer.org/actions-scix/analyze) for a library are available, similar to those available from the search results page or an abstract page. Click on the Metrics button within the library to view.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-library-metrics.gif)\n### Visualizations: paper network, author network, word cloud\nThe same [visualizations](https://scixplorer.org/actions-scix/visualize) available in the search results page are available within a SciX library.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-author_network.gif)\n### Beginning a literature search\n### How do you start a literature search in SciX?\n_Note: the Getting Started series is designed to get you started with the new interface. More advanced information on searching can be found in the[Second Order Queries](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/second-order) and [Article View](https://scixplorer.org/actions-scix/article-view) help pages and other pages in the “Making a Query” and “Search Results” sections._\nStarting research on a new topic can be tricky, especially when you don’t know which papers you should be reading. How do you make sure you’ve covered everything and are fully up to speed on your background reading? SciX has some tools to help. We’ve divided this quick start guide into three sections, depending on the starting point: starting from an individual paper, from a broad topic or keyword, or from an existing library. Read on for more.\n### Starting from an individual paper\nIf you have one or two reference or other papers you’re starting your search with, there are a few sources of potentially related papers.

In addition to the paper suggestions offered by the in-library Paper Network, you can use the Explore menu to discover related papers and add them to your library.\n### Searching for papers by an author with a common name\n### How do you find a paper by an author with a common name?\n_Note: the Getting Started series is designed to get you started with the new interface. More advanced information on searching can be found in the[Search Syntax help page](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/search-syntax) and other pages in the “Making a Query” and “Search Results” sections._\nFinding a paper by an author with a common name, especially if you have little else to go on, can be like finding a needle in a haystack. However, there are some strategies that can help.\n### Exact name matching\nBy default, SciX returns all relevant matches when searching for author names. For example, searching for _author:”smith, j”_ will return results for J. Smith, Jane Smith, and John Smith, amongst others. To disable this synonym expansion, use the equals sign operator (=). Searching for _=author:”smith, j”_ will only return results where the first initial was used in place of the full spelled-out given name.\n### Filtering results\nThe facets are useful when trying to narrow down a large list of search results. In addition to the author facet, which allows you to include or exclude name variations of authors, try these facets. All are located in the left-hand column, unless otherwise noted:\n  * Collections: by default, records from all database collections (astronomy, physics, and general) are searched from the one-box modern search interface. Limit or exclude collections here as necessary\n  * Refereed: limit your search to refereed or non-refereed records\n  * Years: located in the right-hand column, the year sliders allow you to select a publication year or range of publication years to include or exclude\n  * Publications: if the journal or other publication name is known, select it here\n  * Bib Groups: some telescopes and research institutes maintain curated listings of records relevant to their institutions; these groupings are listed here\n  * Data: filter based on the availability of specific links to data products, such as NASA missions, archives, SIMBAD, and NED\n  * SIMBAD and NED Objects: filter based on a specific object\n\n\n### I’m an author with a common name; how do I make my papers easier to find?\nIf you’re an author with a common name, there are some strategies you can follow to make your papers more discoverable.\n### Tips & Tricks\n  * Include your full name and at least your middle initial in author lists.\n  * If possible, use the same form of your name (e.g. initial vs. spelled-out form of your given or middle names) when publishing.\n  * If you’ve changed your name (given or family name) since you’ve begun publishing, email us at help@scixplorer.org and we can link your name variations together. Thereafter, searching for one name variation will return publications under all linked names.\n\n\n### ORCID\nCreate an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/). After obtaining your ID, [claim your papers in SciX](https://scixplorer.org/orcid-scix/claiming-papers). We’ll do some basic checks to make sure you haven’t claimed someone else’s papers by mistake and link your ORCID ID to your papers within 24 hours. As part of this process, the papers you claim within SciX will automatically be pushed to your ORCID record on [orcid.org](https://orcid.org/). For current and future publications, many journals (such as ApJ) now accept ORCID IDs upon submission; ORCID IDs submitted this way will automatically populate in SciX after paper publication.\nAfter linking your ORCID ID with your publications, users will be able to search for your papers using the syntax _orcid:XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX_. You may link to the search results using this syntax: https://scixplorer.org/search?q=orcid%3AXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX\n### Public library\nIn some situations, [creating a library](https://scixplorer.org/libraries-scix/creating-libraries), [making it public](https://scixplorer.org/libraries-scix/public-libraries), and sharing the link may be useful.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "#  SciX Libraries \nSciX Libraries are designed to help you create and organize collections of bibliographic records. You can use them to keep track of sources for an article, build your CV, or share references with colleagues.\nPlease note: SciX Libraries are available only to registered users. If you don't have an account yet, head over to the [sign-up page](https://scixplorer.org/user/account/register) to get started.\n### Creating and editing a library\nThere are two ways to create an SciX library:\n  1. From the [search results page](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=star), select your relevant papers, and select **Bulk Actions** and then **Add to library**. Fill in a library name and press submit.\n  2. Go the **My Account** drop down and select **SciX Libraries**. Press the **Add New Library** button.\n\n\nIt is possible to modify the name and description of the library you have created. To do this, simply navigate to the SciX Libraries page from the **My Account** drop down, at the top right of the web interface. Once there, you can select your library of interest, and click the gear icon to modify the attributes you would like to change.\nTo delete any of the records in your library, first select the record you want to remove, then click the **Delete** button. To delete the entire library, click the gear icon, then select the “delete library” button. Once deleted, a library is gone forever, so click with caution!\n### Making your library public and managing permissions\nYou can make your library publicly viewable to non-SciX users. First, navigate to SciX Libraries page from the My Account drop down, then click on the library you’d like to make public. Click on the gear icon to access the library settings, then toggle Make library public? and click Save to make it public. This button generates a unique URL that you can give to people to view your library. You have the option to make your library private again in the future, in the same part of the interface. By default, all libraries are private.\nYou can also add collaborators to a library to allow other users to view, edit, and/or administrate your library. Available permissions:\n  * _Read Only_ : Can view the contents of a private library\n  * _Read & Write_: Can view a library and add/remove records to it\n  * _Admin_ : Can view a library, add/remove records, edit the library name and description, and add/remove other collaborators\n\n\nTo add a collaborator:\n  1. Click the gear icon and scroll to the Collaborators section.\n  2. Fill out the email address of the user you’d like to add as a collaborator (they must have an SciX user account under this email address) and choose their permission level.\n  3. Click **Add Collaborator** to finish adding the user. The user will be emailed to notify them of their updated permissions.\n\n\nEditing collaborators’ permissions or revoking their access can be done directly from the **Manage Access** tab.\n_Note that you must be the library owner or have admin permissions to add, edit, or remove collaborators._\n### Set Operations\nSet operations allow you to perform operations on one or more libraries. To access these, click the **Operations** button in the upper right of the [main page listing all of your libraries](https://scixplorer.org/user/libraries/).\nThe Operations button will open the **Library Operations** window, where you can select one of the available set operations:\n  * _Union_ : take the union of the primary and all of the secondary libraries. The result, which includes all papers in any of the input libraries, is saved to a new library\n  * _Intersection_ : take the intersection of the primary and all of the secondary libraries. The result, which includes only papers present in all of the input libraries, is saved to a new library\n  * _Difference_ : take the difference between the primary and all of the secondary libraries. The result, which includes papers present in the primary library but in none of the secondary libraries, is saved to a new library\n  * _Copy_ : copy the contents of the source library into the target library. The target library is not emptied first; use the empty operation on the target library first in order to create a duplicate of the source library in the target library\n  * _Empty_ : empty the source library of its contents (no secondary library is needed)\n\n\nAfter selecting the set operation, select the primary (or source) library, and any secondary (or target) libraries, as needed. Note that more than one secondary library is allowed when taking the union, intersection, or difference; add another secondary library as needed.\nYou may also choose to supply a new library name for the result of the union, intersection, or difference operations. If no name is supplied, a default name will be used, which can be edited after the library is created.\n### Visualisations, Metrics, and Exports\nLike the main search interface, you can make visualisations, look at metrics, and create exports for the bibcodes within your library.\nTo do so, simply navigate to your SciX Library via the button under **My Account** and then click **View as search results** to access the **Explore** menu, including visualizations and metrics, and the **Bulk Actions** menu to export the library.\nFor details on these features, look at the main [help pages](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/actions-scix).\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

Enter in 1) your current affiliation, and 2) any name variations under which you might have published. Submitting the form will grant SciX permission to track your claims, allowing us to put your data in our system and marking it as trusted so that others can find it.\n  4. **Claim papers.** Search for your name variations in the search interface. Make sure ORCID mode is “on” (click on the ORCID button in the navigation bar to toggle the setting). Claim papers individually by clicking the Claim in ORCID button under a relevant search result. You can also claim multiple papers at once by selecting the check boxes next to the relevant search results and clicking the Claim from Scix option in the Bulk Actions dropdown menu.\n  5. **Check your claims in SciX!** Your ORCID claims take up to **24 hours** to be indexed in SciX. After that, you should be able to search for your ORCID papers in SciX by using the search term: _orcid:[orcid id]_.\n\n\n### Alternate Method\nIf you just want to use SciX to send claims to your ORCID profile.

Under our name change policy, SciX will change names in the metadata used for searching and display the preferred name but will not be able to change the names on full text articles previously published, as these are created and maintained by journal publishers. If you are interested in seeing these modifications applied to the full text manuscript, please contact the responsible publisher. Alternatively, if you would rather just link your two names so that both are returned when searching for either, we can add an author synonym to enable this.

    "content": "## Searching for a Specific Paper\n### How do you search for a specific paper?\n_Note: the Getting Started series is designed to get you started with the new interface. More advanced information on searching can be found in the[Search Syntax help page](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/search-syntax) and other pages in the “Making a Query” and “Search Results” sections._\nA common task in SciX is locating a specific paper, often for download or for retrieval of the bibliographic data. In this case, a user usually knows an author name (often the name of the first author), plus a publication year. This type of search is simple, but knowing some tips and tricks can make the process proceed more quickly and smoothly.\n### Tips\n  * Use fielded queries to ensure you receive the expected results.\n  * Use the [Classic Form](https://scixplorer.org/#classic-form) to automatically create fielded queries and replicate the SciX Classic look and feel. (Note: advanced and fulltext search fields are not available in the Classic Form.)\n  * Make use of tag auto-completion when entering fielded queries to speed up search term entry.\n  * It is not generally recommended that you initially search on author affiliation as a number of publishers do not provide this information to SciX. Additionally, variants on institution name may confuse the search results.\n\n\n### Fielded vs. unfielded queries\nThe one-box search field accepts both fielded queries, where the user specifies the field being searched (such as _year:_) along with the search terms, and unfielded queries, where no search fields are explicitly specified. Unfielded queries automatically search all metadata fields; this may not produce the expected results.\nWe recommend that you use the field tags (e.g. _author:_) when searching for a known author and/or year of publication. However, you do not have to type the full tag or select it from the list each time you search. Auto-completion is enabled, so you can start typing the tag, then press Return to accept the auto-complete when the appropriate tag is shown. The cursor will automatically be moved to the appropriate spot within the tag to type the search term.\n### Querying when author and year of publication are known\n  1. Click on the author tag in the Quick Field area, or start typing _author:_ and press Return to accept the auto-completion.\n  2. Fill in the author name.\n  3. Do the same for the year: tag and year of publication.\n  4. Press Return or click the Search button to begin the search.\n\n![a short\n   animated image showing querying by author and year](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-author.gif)\n### Querying when the first author is known\nFollow the same procedure as for a known author, but to trigger the first-author tag autocompletion, use the standard caret (^) operator or start typing “first author.”\nNote: for a first-author search using the ^ operator, you do not have to specify the author tag. Typing _^last_name_ is an abbreviation for _author:”^last_name”_ and will produce the expected results.\n![a short\n   animated image showing querying by first author using the caret operator](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-caret_firstauthor.gif)\n### Filtering\nIf your search by author and/or publication year returns too many results, you can use [interactive filtering](https://scixplorer.org/search-scix/filter) to narrow down the results instead of editing your original search query. Filtering by author or publication is often useful when a paper is known.\n![](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/sciximg/scix-filter-facet.png)\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "subsection": "What's New",
    "content": "## (Advanced) Author Search\nThe following section describes, in ugly detail, the logic of author parsing and searching.\n## Referenced resources\n## Big Picture\nWhat happens when we search for `author:\"Adamczuk, Peter\"`?\nFirst, the query string is turned into an abstract syntax tree (see [search parser](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-parser) for details). The query parser will see that we are searching the field `author` and apply the tokenizer chain (rules) specified for that field. So it will run the input through the author tokenizer, which has a number of steps involved in transforming the input text into what gets indexed and searched.\nThere is also quite a difference between what we do at **index** time, and at the **search** time in order to optimize searches and maximize both precision and recall.\n### Details\nLet’s consider as an example the case of an author whose full name is `Adamčuk, Piotr Gavrilov Eugenyi`.\nPeople using our search engine may be unable to remember all his names, misremember the last name as `Adamczuk`, assume his first name with `Peter` (which he has occasionally published under), and not know about his additional middle names `Gavrilov` and `Eugenyi` which might have been transcribed in the past in multiple ways such as `Evgenij`, `Eugenij`, `Eugen`, `Evzen`.\nAs you can imagine, balancing accuracy and retrieval for author names searches is going to be tricky. Let’s imagine that a user searches for this scientist’s paper using the following query:\n```\nauthor:\"peter adamczuk\"\n\n```\n\n#### Normalization\nThe first step we perform is name normalization, in order to ensure that the author name is properly formatted. Our _search_ tokenizer is going to take the input in its entirety (the full string `peter adamczuk` with **NO** tokenization into `peter` and `adamczuk`) and will pass the input to a [name parsing Python library](https://pypi.org/project/nameparser/). Since the search engine is written in Java, in reality the library will be executed by [Jython](https://www.jython.org/).\nThe library will parse the input string to identify its components: surname, first name, and optionally middle name(s), titles, suffixes, etc. So `Pope John Paul the II` would lose all his titles and be normalized to `Paul, John, II`. In our example, `Peter` is recognized as the first name, and `Adamczuk` as the last name.\nNormalization also involves removal of excessive whitespace, punctuation, hyphens, apostrophes, etc. For example, `Adamczuk  ,               P ` becomes `Adamczuk, P`, and `Lao'tzu` becomes `Lao tzu,`. We also limit the number of names allowed for a single author to 6 tokens.\n#### Transliteration\nThe next step involves name transliterations, which map “similar” classes of characters to a common format. English is the Lingua Franca of scientific discourse, but author names span a huge variety of character sets. Transliterations allow author names containing a variety of accented characters to be found when searching for their ASCII equivalent. For example, a search for `jonas` would find the name `jonáš` as well. Internally in our database we use the `UTF-8` character encoding so that we can properly represent the original author name but we don’t force the English-centric writers to think in more than 26 characters of the English alphabet.\nSo in the case of `adamczuk, p` at this stage we will discover that the SciX database contains `adamčuk, peter` and any of its variations such as `adamčuk, p` if present.\nHow are transliterations generated and managed? We periodically go through our author index and for each name not already in ASCII format we generate its equivalent mappings, for example:\n```\nadamczuk, p => adamčuk, p\nadamczuk, peter => adamčuk, peter\nadamczuk, piotr => adamčuk, piotr\n\n```\n\nSome of the transliteration rules are custom to SciX, but the majority stemming from Java Unidecode library. The generated vocabulary of names has at this point millions of entries and contains every non-Latin character that has ever appeared in the SciX author database. The dictionary is then used (at search time) to lookup `UTF-8` variants when users give us an `ASCII` name.\n#### Synonyms\nNormalization and transliteration transform the original input from `peter adamzuk` to `adamczuk, peter`, to (`adamczuk, peter`, `adamčuk, peter`). Next we proceed to discover all other known names of this person. SciX curators maintain a knowledge base of known name changes and aliases for scientists in our database. That is what gets consulted in the next step, where we might discover that `adamčuk, peter` has also published as `adamčuk, piotr` and was previously known as `adamčuková, petra`, in which case we augment our name search to include the additional variation.\nSo the parser will tentatively generate a multitude of possible names and spellings and will use them all to search for them. As a way of example, this is what we’ll get:\n  * adamzuk, peter\n  * adamczuk, peter\n  * adamčuk, peter\n  * adamčuk, piotr\n  * adamčuková, petra\n\n\nAll these names were added because our parser consulted the knowledge base of author names. Our parser doesn’t know this is one and the same person; but it has a way of seeing/discovering the chain of name changes. If the knowledge database is correct, which is most of the time, it will be able to start from the user input and arrive at other names.\nNext, we’ll use all of the author names discovered so far, and take one step further – we’ll generate all the possible name variations that might be derived from them using abbreviations. For example, an author with a middle name such as `John James Doe` might appear in the scientific literature as `Doe, J.`, `Doe, John`, `Doe, John J.`, and possibly `Doe, John James` and `Doe, John J.`\nAt query time, the author search will adapt its strategy based on the user input. If for example the user entered `acamczuk, p` then our parser will assume they are looking for any `adamczuk` whose first name starts with “p” (i.e. `adamczuk, p*`), and give them all peters, piotrs, pauls, pans and pons. However, if the user typed `adamczuk, peter` then the search engine will instead return `adamczuk, peter`, `adamczuk, peter <some other name>`, `adamczuk, p`, `adamczuk, p <some other name>` and all of the variations and synonyms thereof (`adamčuk, peter`, `adamčuková, petra`, `adamčuková, petra *`, etc.)\n### Conclusions\nSo what started as a seemingly simple search has, behind the scenes, transformed into a massive and very complicated query. Our implementation of author searches attempts to strike a balance between the desire to be precise, and the desire to be inclusive (recall). The logic is complex, it takes advantage of what SciX knows about publishing conventions and supplements it with a curated knowledge base, which we regularly update based on user input.\nIf an author search produces unexpected results, it usually is because of these reasons:\n  * the curated knowledge base is too broad or too narrow: i.e. it is missing a synonym, or has a synonym too many – and joins unrelated names together\n  * haphazard interferences: the transliterations as implemented mistakenly map distinct author names to the same equivalent ASCII version, and end up retrieving records authored by distinct scientists with similar names\n\n\nOne possible solution to the ambiguity problem is to perform an exact author search, which bypasses the steps described above by prepending the equal sign (`=`) to the author search field, e.g. `=author:\"adamčuk, peter\"`.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

Should you want a list of all the articles which **cite those search results** , or all the articles which **are referenced by those search results** , you can use the citation or reference operators.\nThe syntax for these operators are _references(query)_ and _citations(query)_.\nExample Query | Explanation  \n---|---  \ncitations(author:“huchra, john”) | returns the list of records citing John Huchra’s papers  \nreferences(bibcode:2003AJ….125..525J) | returns records cited by the paper 2003AJ….125..525J  \ncitations(abstract:JWST) | returns records citing papers which have “JWST” in their abstract  \nreferences(data:Chandra) | returns records cited by papers in the Chandra data bibliography  \nOne powerful aspect of having these operators at our disposal when creating a query is that we can combine them with additional search terms to expand or narrow your query.

The syntax for this operator is _pos(fieldedquery,position,[endposition])_. If no _endposition_ is given, then it is assumed to be _endposition = position_ , otherwise this performs a query within the range _[position, endposition]_ where _position_ is the leftmost position considered and _endposition_ is the rightmost. For example:\nExample | Results  \n---|---  \npos(author:”Oort, J”,2) | papers that have “J.

    "content": "## (Advanced) Search Syntax\nThe following page describes extra details about the search syntax not found in the otherwise comprehensive [search syntax help](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-syntax).\n## Big Picture\nThe search has two distinct phases:\n  1. building the query\n  2. executing the query, collecting results\n\n\nThe first phase is what we are going to discuss here. We’ll break it down further into:\n  1. parsing text into the AST (abstract syntax tree)\n  2. modifying the query tree (semantic parsing)\n  3. building the query object\n\n\n### Building the Query\nThe [Search Grammar](https://github.com/adsabs/montysolr/blob/main/montysolr/src/main/antlr/ADS.g) defines the search language of SciX. It is a context-free grammar and it is used to generate a client library ([by ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)).\nIf you don’t like reading context-free computer grammars (who does?) you’ll find a good explanation of SciX syntax here: [search syntax help](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-syntax).\nBut as a reward for having found this obscure corner of the help, we’ll illustrate a few more special situations not covered there.\n### Operators\nThe search operators have the following precedence (from higher to lower priority): `NEARx -> NOT -> AND -> OR -> \" \"`\nSome details worth mentioning:\n**Empty space is the default AND**\nBetter to illustrate it by way of examples:\n`jim and john not mary` becomes behind the scenes: `(jim AND (john NOT mary))` because `NOT` has precedence over `AND`. But `john jim and mary` becomes `(john AND (jim AND mary))` because `AND` operator has precedence over empty space (operator) – notice how `jim and mary` is evaluated as a group: i.e. the query is **not** parsed as `john AND jim AND mary`.\n**You can modify the default operator**\nIt can also be changed on demand by adding `q.op=OR` into URL parameters (i.e. NOT inside the search form), in which case the logic will change dramatically. For any given query the results will contain many more records, but if sorted by relevancy score, the top items will be still the ones returned with the default `AND` operator.\n**SciX supports proximity searches for text fields**\nYes, many people may not know about it, but you can do stuff like: `title:(dog NEAR5 cat)` – this will find any mention of the barking animal appearing up to 5 text words (tokens) from the meowing animal. The `NEAR` has to be followed by a number [1-5] and it will not care about the order; i.e. `cat NEAR5 dog` == `dog NEAR5 cat` – this search can be very powerful, especially if applied against fulltext. It can also be quite expensive (computationally) - especially when the search term(s) have synonyms. Use this operator with fielded queries on text fields such as `full`, `abs`, `title`.\n**There is no in-order proximity operator, but SciX still supports this feature**\nSciX has a limited support for **in-order proximity** - if you make a phrase search like so `abs:\"newtonian solar\"~3` the word `newtonian` (and its synonyms) will have to be followed by `solar` (and its synonyms) for up to 3 positions away. We do not have a special operator for it though; if what you search for has more than 2 words, we’ll decide how far apart they can be. For example if you do `abs:\"one two three\"~3` then `one` may be 3 words away from `two three` (and it doesn’t matter that there are really 4 tokens between `one` and `three`).\n### Syntax Parsing\nOK, so back to the syntactic parsing – how does it actually work? We have a formal grammar which describes the query language. Based on that, we have generated a library (in Java) which is included inside SOLR, our search engine. When SOLR receives the user input, before it can start searching for documents, the user query (string) will be turned into a query object. And that is the objective of the parser. First comes the syntactic phase during which an ANTLR parser will be ‘eating’ input character by character. It will occassionally veer off to explore a possible (alternative) branch, to either pursue it further or return back and start branching from some previous position. The input has to be syntactically correct; if we explored all possible readings and there are still some input characters left, it means the input is non-conforming and we’ll generate an exception and give up.\nIf the query is correct, however, after the parser is finished parsing, we’ll have the **AST** (Abstract Syntax Tree): a hierarchical datastructure (a tree) instead of the flat chain of characters.\nHere an example (it is only an illustration, inside the search engine the AST will be richer):\n```\n\"(this) (that)\" \t->\t\n                            (DEFOP \n(CLAUSE (                               (CLAUSE (\n    DEFOP (                                 DEFOP (\n        MODIFIER (                              MODIFIER (\n            TMODIFIER (                             TMODIFIER (\n                FIELD (                                 FIELD (\n                    QNORMAL this))))))                      QNORMAL that)))))))\n\n```\n\nIn human words: the input `(this) (that)` has been parsed into an `AST`; the tree starts at a `DEFOP` node (default operator) which has two children (`CLAUSE`s). Each `CLAUSE` itself is made of a strict chain of components: `DEFOP->MODIFIER->TMODIFIER->FIELD` – they are all empty (with implicit value of none). It is only after we have arrived to a terminus `QNORMAL` that we also see values. Inside the tree, we will have information about every bracket, position, and links to parent/children.\nThis tree will be further modified in the next phase.\n### Semantic Parsing\nThere is a lot of magic that happens in this next phase. All of it is defined inside the [pipeline](https://github.com/adsabs/montysolr/blob/main/montysolr/src/main/java/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/flexible/aqp/AqpAdsabsNodeProcessorPipeline.java).\nPro tip: if you add `debugQuery=true` to your search request URL parameters (and look at the data as returned by our API), you’ll see the serialized version of the query as parsed by SOLR. For example\n```\n\"debug\":{\n    \"rawquerystring\":\"abs:\\\"newtonian solar\\\"~3\",\n    \"querystring\":\"abs:\\\"newtonian solar\\\"~3\",\n    \"parsedquery\":\"CustomScoreQuery(custom(abstract:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 title:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 keyword:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3, sum(float(cite_read_boost),const(0.5))))\",\n    \"parsedquery_toString\":\"custom(abstract:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 title:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 keyword:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3, sum(float(cite_read_boost),const(0.5)))\",\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "subsection": "What's New",
    "content": "## Search Syntax\n### Search Basics\nSciX’s one box search form supports both fielded and unfielded queries. Unfielded queries without search terms will search the metadata of the publications, including author, publication year, title, abstract, identifiers, and bibstem, which may not produce the expected results. For instance, if you are searching for papers by the author Marc Mars, you want to search for **author:“Mars, Marc”** instead of **Marc Mars** to make sure that you don’t return papers that simply have the words “Marc” and “Mars” somewhere in the article metadata.\n### Fielded Searches\nAbove the search box we supply shortcuts to frequently used search fields. Simply click on the field that you wish to search and enter your search term in the provided location (generally between the supplied quotation marks). Alternatively, if you start entering the name of a field an autocomplete feature will suggest a list of possible search fields. You may string several search terms or use the filters provided with your results to help narrow the search selection. For instance if you want to find articles published between 1980 and 1990 by John Huchra, you can use:\n```\nauthor:\"Huchra, John\" year:1980-1990\n\n```\n\nTo get you started, here is a list of search examples for commonly used fields:\nExample Query | Explanation  \n---|---  \nauthor:“huchra, john” | search for papers written by an author  \nauthor:“^huchra, john” | limit search to first-author papers  \n^“huchra, john” | limit search to first-author papers  \nabs:“dark energy” | search for the phrase “dark energy” in abstract, title and keywords  \nyear:2000 | search for publications written in 2000  \nyear:2000-2005 | search for publications written between 2000 and 2005 (inclusive)  \nbody:“gravitational waves” | search for papers containing the phrase “gravitational waves” in the body of an article  \nfull:“gravitational waves” | search for papers containing the phrase “gravitational waves” in a number of fields (title, abstract, body, acknowledgements and keywords)  \nbibstem:ApJ | select papers published in a particular publication  \nobject:((SMC OR LMC) AND M31) | using the SIMBAD and NED object search, find papers tagged with either SMC or LMC and M31  \nThe rest of this page goes over the search syntax and fields indexed in our database.\n### Combining Search Terms to Make a Compound Query\nYou can string together any number of search terms to develop a query. By default search terms will be combined using AND as the default boolean operator, but this can be changed by explicitly specifying OR beween them. Similarly one can exclude a term by prepending a “-“ sign to it (or using the boolean “NOT”). Multiple search words or phrases may be grouped in a fielded query by enclosing them in parenthesis. Some examples:\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \nabstract:(QSO “dark energy”) | papers containing both “QSO” and “dark energy” in their abstract  \nabstract:(QSO OR “dark energy”) | papers containing either “QSO” or “dark energy in their abstract  \nauthor:“huchra, j” abstract:cfa | papers by J. Huchra which have “cfa” in their abstract  \nauthor:“huchra, j” OR abstract:“great wall” | papers by J. Huchra or which mention “great wall” in their abstract  \nauthor:“huchra, j” -title:2mass | papers by “J. Huchra” but excludes ones with “2mass” in their title  \nauthor:“huchra, j” NOT title:2mass | same as above  \nauthor:“accomazzi, a.” author:“kurtz, m.” | papers authored by both A. Accomazzi and M. Kurtz  \nauthor:(“accomazzi, a.” “kurtz, m.”) | same as above  \n**Operator precedence in multi-part searches**\nSearches involving only two search terms, as shown above, are straightforward to parse. However, for searches with multiple search terms and multiple operators, understanding how operators take precendence over each other is important. For the most control, use parentheses around terms and operators that should be executed first. Otherwise, operators follow these general rules:\n  * AND, OR, and NOT are set operators, operating on the search terms on either side. AND takes the intersection of the result set of the two search terms, OR takes the union, and NOT takes the difference. NOT takes precendence over AND, which takes precendence over OR.\n  * The default AND (i.e., not typing out AND but using just a blank space between the two terms, as in the first example above) has lower precedence than any of the Boolean operators above.\n  * The negative sign (-) is read as “prohibit”; results containing this term are completely excluded. In multi-part queries, its behavior can differ from that of NOT, because of the precedence rules.\n\nExample Query | Parsed as  \n---|---  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” AND Taiwan) | aff:(China OR (“Hong Kong” AND Taiwan))  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” Taiwan) | aff:((China OR “Hong Kong”) AND Taiwan)  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” NOT Taiwan) | aff:(China OR (“Hong Kong” NOT Taiwan))  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” -Taiwan) | aff:((China OR “Hong Kong”) NOT Taiwan)  \nFor a more heavy handed exploration of the search syntax, feel free to visit the [search parser details page](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-parser).\n### Synonyms and Acronyms\nBy default most search terms in SciX are expanded by adding a list of words which are synonyms of the search term. So for example, a search of “star” in the title field will be expanded to include words such as “stars,” “stellar,” “starry,” “starlike,” and so on. (Notice that this often includes words in foreign languages such as “etoile,” “stern,” and “stella”). While this feature improves recall, it sometimes compromises the precision of the results. Our search engine allows one to turn off the synonym expansion feature by simply prepending an “=” sign in front of the search term.\nOur search engine also identifies acronyms during indexing and searching (defined as words consisting entirely of uppercase characters). A search for an uppercase word will only match documents which contain that acronym, whereas a search for a lowercase word will match documents which contain any variation of the word, irregardless of its case. Acronyms can themselves have synonyms (for example “SciX” and “Astrophysics Data System” are synonyms), so one should be aware that there is an interaction between case-sensitiveness and synonym expansion. The examples below illustrate these effects:\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \ntitle:star | title contains “star”, any of its synonyms, or the acronym “STAR”  \ntitle:etoile | title contains “star” or any of its synonyms (etoile being a synonym of star);   \nthe results differ from above since “STAR” is not searched for  \n=title:star | title contains “star” or the acronym “STAR”  \n=title:etoile | title contains “etoile”  \ntitle:STAR | title contains the acronym “STAR”  \ntitle:(=star -STAR) | title contains “star” but not the acronym “STAR”  \nfuse | the word “fuse” or acronym “FUSE” appear anywhere in the paper  \nFUSE | the acronym “FUSE” appears anywhere in paper  \n### Author Searches\nSynoym expansion also applies to author names, which provide a way to account for changes in a person’s name and/or different spellings due to transliterations. In addition to this, the default author search in SciX is “greedy” in the sense that it will return all documents in which an author signature may match the input search string. This allows, for instance, to have an author search for “Huchra, John” to return papers where the author name appears as “Huchra, John” or “Huchra, J.” By prepending the “=” character to the author search one can disable this feature (as well as any additional synonym expansion) and require an exact match on the author name. Some examples:\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \nauthor:\"murray, s\" | Least precise variations: finds records authored by any of the following:\n  * Murray, Stephen S.\n  * Murray, Stephen\n  * Murray, S. S. \n  * Murray, S.\n  * Murray, Stephen D.\n  * Murray, S. D.\n  * Murray, Sarah S.\n  * Murray, Scott\n  * ...\n\n(any possible combination with last name \"murray\" and first name starting with S)   \nauthor:\"murray, stephen\" | More precise variations: finds record authored by any of the following: \n  * Murray, Stephen S.\n  * Murray, Stephen\n  * Murray, S. S.\n  * Murray, S.\n  * Murray, Stephen D.\n  * Murray, S. D.\n  * ...\n\n(any possible variation of \"Murray, Stephen\" with or without middle name)  \nauthor:\"murray, stephen s\" | Most precise variations: finds record authored by any of the following: \n  * Murray, Stephen S.\n  * Murray, Stephen\n  * Murray, S. S.\n  * Murray, S.\n\n(any possible variation of \"Murray, Stephen S\" but no others)  \n=author:\"murray, s\" | Matches only records authored by \"Murray, S.\"  \n=author:\"murray, stephen\" | Matches only records authored by \"Murray, Stephen\"  \n=author:\"murray, stephen s\" | Matches only records authored by \"Murray, Stephen S.\"  \nAs a general rule we recommend to use the full name of the person for author searches since as can be seen above the matching rules in SciX are designed to find the maximal set of records consistent with the author specification given by the user. Rather than disabling the name-variation algorithm described above, we recommend performing refinement of search results via the user interface filters for author names as described in the [“Filter your search” section](https://scixplorer.org/help/search/filter).\nThe logic behind the author search is rather complicated, if you would like to learn more, visit the [advanced author search page](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/author-search).\n### Affiliation Searches\nAffiliations in SciX have been indexed in several different search fields, with the intention of allowing multiple use cases. We have currently assigned affiliation identifiers allowing for parent/child relationships, such as an academic department within a university. Note that a child may have multiple parents, but we restrict a child from having children of its own. The list of recognized institutions is available from our [Canonical Affiliation repository](https://github.com/adsabs/CanonicalAffiliations/blob/master/parent_child.tsv) on Github.\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \naff:“UCLA” | Searches the raw affiliation string, searchable word-by-word  \ninst:“UCLA” | Searches the curated institution name listed in our mapping of organizations to identifiers, which returns all variations of UCLA (e.g. UCLA; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California - Los Angeles)  \nFor a breakdown to department level:\n  * Use the “Institutions” filter in the left panel of search results\n  * Use parent/child syntax as defined in our list of Canonical Affiliations linked above (e.g. inst:“UCLA/IGPP”)\n\n\nUsers are reminded that while affiliation information is largely complete for recent refereed literature, not all records contain an affiliation; therefore, searching by affiliation alone will inherently be incomplete. We strongly recommend combining affiliation searches with author searches for best results.\n### Astronomical Objects and Position Search\nThe query modifier `object:` in fielded searches allows users to search the literature for bibliographic records that have been tagged with astronomical objects by SIMBAD and NED, or for a specified position on the sky (“cone search”). The cone search also makes use of services offered by SIMBAD and NED.\nQueries for astronomical objects via `object:` queries return publications that have been tagged with the canonical names for these objects. This tagging has been done by the SIMBAD and NED teams. Additionally, the object names (as specified in the query) are also used in a SciX query against abstracts, titles and keywords in the astronomy collection (with synonym replacement switched off). The result set is a combination of all these matches. Object queries that target just one service (e.g. SIMBAD) are not currently supported. The `data` facet can be used to filter the results set.\nThe syntax for cone searches is:\n```\n  object:\"RA ±Dec:radius\"\n\n```\n\nwhere RA and Dec are right ascention and declination J2000 positions, expressed in decimal degrees or in sexagesimal notation (hours minutes seconds and degrees arcmin and arcsec). The plus or minus sign before the declination is **_mandatory_**. The search radius may be given in arcmin, decimal or sexagesimal degrees (The default search radius is 2’, and the maximum is 60’). Examples:\n  * A 10’ radius may be written as 0.1667 or 0 10\n  * The following 3 notations are equivalent: \n    1. 05h23m34.6s -69d45m22s\n    2. 05 23 34.6 -69 45 22\n    3. 80.894167 -69.756111\n\n\nSearching for publications tagged with objects returned by the coordinates in the example above, with a search radius of 10’ is done as follows:\n```\nobject:\"05h23m34.6s -69d45m22s:0.1667\"\n\n```\n\n### Wildcards, Proximity, and Regular expression search\nExample Query | Explanation  \n---|---  \nauthor:“huchra, jo*” | multi-character wildcard; search for papers written by `huchra, john`, `huchra, jonathan`, `huchra, jolie`, and anything in between  \nauthor:“bol?,” | single-character wildcard; in this case we may get back `bolt`, `boln`, `bolm`  \ntitle:(map NEAR5 planar) | instead of a phrase search, we can ask the search engine to consider words be close to each other – the maximum allowed distance is 5; the operator must be written as `NEAR[number]`; in this example the search terms can appear in any order but there will be at most 5 other terms between (not counting stopwords such as `a`, `the`, `in`…). **The proximity search must be used only against fielded search, i.e. inside one index. You cannot use proximity search to find an author name next to a title**. If you are looking for token that appear next to each other, then please use a phrase search. For fields that are not tokenized (such as author names) use semicolon as a separator, e.g. `author:\"kurtz, m; accomazzi, a\" OR author:\"accomazzi, a; kurtz, m\"` – in a phrase search the order is important, so we much try both variants.  \n`facility:/magell.*/` | Regular expression searches are possible but are less useful than you might expect. Firstly, the regex can match only against indexed tokens - i.e. it is not possible to search for multiple words next to each other. So in practice, this type of search is more useful for fields that contain `string` tokens (as opposed to `text` tokens). In practice, this means that a field which contains many words (such as `title`, `abstract`, `body`) is a text field, but a field with only limited number of values is typically defined as a `string` - for example, `author`, `facility`, `page`. You can use regex in both `string` and `text` fields but you have to be aware that regular expression is only going to match **indexed tokens**. In the case of `string` fields tokens may be multi-word combinations, depending on the specific field. For example, in the `author` field one token is `huchra, john`, but in fulltext the same content will be indexed as two tokens: `huchra`, `john`. In all cases the tokens are normalized (typically by lowercasing the input data). A little bit or more of experimentation (test queries) should be enough to help you determine your ‘adversary’. For description of allowed regex patterns, please see: [Lucene documentation](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_0_1/core/org/apache/lucene/util/automaton/RegExp.html)  \n### Available Fields\nThis is a list of fields currently recognized by SciX search engine and the preferred search format - go to [comprehensive list of fields](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/comprehensive-solr-term-list) if not saturated yet:\nField Name | Syntax | Example | Notes  \n---|---|---|---  \nAbstract/Title/Keywords | abs:“phrase” | abs:“dark energy” | search for word or phrase in abstract, title and keywords  \nAbstract | abstract:“phrase” | abstract:“dark energy” | search for a word or phrase in an abstract only  \nAcknowledgements | ack:“phrase” | ack:“SciX” | search for a word or phrase in the acknowledgements  \nAffiliation | aff:“phrase” | aff:“harvard” | search for word or phrase in the raw, provided affiliation field  \nAffiliation ID | aff_id:ID | aff_id:A00211 | search for an affiliation ID listed in the [Canonical Affiliations list](https://github.com/adsabs/CanonicalAffiliations/blob/master/parent_child.tsv) in the _child_ column.

In most cases, filtering of results based on these fields is available in the user interface.\n### Properties\nThe “properties” search field allows one to restrict the search results to papers which belong to a particular class. The allowed properties currently include:\nProperty flag | Selection  \n---|---  \nads_openaccess | An OA version of article is available from SciX  \narticle | The record corresponds to a regular article  \nassociated | The record has associated articles available  \nauthor_openaccess | An author-submitted OA version is available  \ndata | One or more data links are available, see `data` field  \neprint_openaccess | An OA version of article is available from a preprint server (e.g. arXiv)  \nesource | An electronic source is available, see `esource` field  \ninspire | A corresponding record is available in the INSPIRE database  \nlibrary_catalog | A corresponding record is available from a library catalog  \nnonarticle | The record is not a regular article; applies to e.g. meeting abstracts, software, catalog descriptions, etc  \nnotrefereed | The record is not peer reviewed (refereed)  \nocr_abstract | The record’s abstract was generated from OCR (may contain typos or mistakes)  \nopenaccess | The record has at least one openaccess version available  \npresentation | The record has one or more media presentations associated with it  \npub_openaccess | An OA version of article is available from publisher  \nrefereed | The record is peer reviewed (refereed)  \ntoc | The record has a Table Of Content (TOC) associated with it  \n### Bibliographic Groups\nThe “bibgroup” search field allows restriction of the search results to one of the [SciX bibliographic groups](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/bibgroups). These groups are curated by a number of librarians and archivists who maintain either institutional or “telescope” bibliographies on behalf of their projects. Here is a partial list. For more information on the criteria behind the curation of these groups, please see the link above.\nThe list of current Institutional bibgroups is: ARI, CfA, CFHT, Leiden, USNO\nThe list of current Telescope bibgroups is: ALMA, CXC, ESO, Gemini, Herschel, HST, ISO, IUE, JCMT, Keck, Magellan, NOIRLab, NRAO, ROSAT, SDO, SMA, Spitzer, Subaru, Swift, UKIRT, XMM\n### Data Links\nThe “property:data” search field can be used to select papers which have data links associated to them. The list of archives which SciX links to can be seen under the “Data” filter selection. To generate a list of all records which have data links one can issue a simple query: [property:data](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=property%3Adata&sort=date+desc). Using the property:data search field allows one to focus on data-rich papers, for example:\n```\nproperty:data AND (CXO OR XMM) AND HST\n\n```\n\nFinds multi-wavelength papers which have observations both in the X-ray spectrum (from Chandra or XMM) and in the optical (HST). Of course additional search terms can be used to further refine the selection criteria.\n### Document Type\nRecords in SciX are assigned a document type which is indexed in the “doctype” search field, the contents of which are an extension of the [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) entry types. Currently these are the document types indexed by SciX:\nDocument Type | Resource associated with record  \n---|---  \narticle | journal article  \neprint | preprinted article  \ninproceedings | article appearing in a conference proceedings  \ninbook | article appearing in a book  \nabstract | meeting abstract  \nbook | book (monograph)  \nbookreview | published book review  \ncatalog | data catalog (or other high-level data product)  \ncircular | printed or electronic circular  \nerratum | erratum to a journal article  \nmastersthesis | Masters thesis  \nnewsletter | printed or electronic newsletter  \nobituary | obituary (article containing “obituary” in its title)  \nphdthesis | PhD thesis  \npressrelease | press release  \nproceedings | conference proceedings book  \nproposal | observing or funding proposal  \nsoftware | software package  \ntalk | research talk given at a scholarly venue  \ntechreport | technical report  \nmisc | anything not found in the above list  \n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## Second-Order Queries\nWe provide five second-order operators which modify the query results by performing second-order operations on the original query. Theese operators are database functions which form secondary queries based on attributes of the objects returned in an initial query; they can provide powerful methods to investigate complex, multipartite information graphs. To invoke the operators, enter the corresponding operator before your search terms (enclosing your search terms in parentheses) in the search box. The search terms enclosed by parentheses are considered the first-order query.\nIn addition to the basic information provided below, we have [published a tutorial describing these operators in detail](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2020BAAS...52.0207K/abstract), both alone and in conjunction with other functions. It is intended for scientists and others who wish to make fuller use of the SciX database.\n**Similar** - The _similar_ operator takes the text of the abstracts of the papers in the first-order query, combines them into a single “document,” then ranks all the abstracts in SciX by their text-based similarity to this combined document, and returns the ranked list. The returned results exclude the articles returned by the first-order query. The documents returned are the most similar, as determined via text analysis, to the topic being researched, while excluding the original documents. For example:\n```\nsimilar(bibcode:2000A&AS..143...41K)\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers that are textually similar to the given paper, while excluding the given paper from the results.\nThe next example:\n```\nsimilar(\"weak lensing\" -entdate:[NOW-7DAYS TO *]) entdate:[NOW-7DAYS TO *] bibstem:\"arXiv\"\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of recent arXiv papers that are textually similar to older papers about weak lensing. Note that since the similar operator excludes results returned by the first-order query, we here use separate date ranges in the first-order query and the outer query in order to force the queries to be disjoint.\n**Trending** – The _trending_ operator takes the lists of readers who read the papers in the first-order query, finds the lists of papers which each of them read, combines these lists, and returns the combined list, sorted by frequency of appearance. The documents returned are most read by users who read recent papers on the topic being researched; these are papers currently being read by people interested in this field. For example:\n```\ntrending(exoplanets)\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers which are currently popular among the readers interested in exoplanets.\n**Useful** – The _useful_ operator takes the reference lists from the papers in the first-order query, combines them and returns this list, sorted by how frequently a referenced paper appears in the combined list. The documents returned are frequently cited by the most relevant papers on the topic being researched; these are studies which discuss methods and techniques useful to conduct research in this field. For example:\n```\nuseful(\"galaxy surveys\")\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers spanning a variety of topics useful to researchers interested in analyzing surveys of galaxies.\n**Reviews** – The _reviews_ operator takes the lists of articles which cited the papers in the first-order query, combines them, and returns this list sorted by how frequently a citing paper appears in the combined list. The documents returned cite the most relevant papers on the topic being researched; these are papers containing the most extensive reviews of the field. For example:\n```\nreviews(\"weak lensing\")\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers featuring reviews of weak gravitational lensing and its cosmological implications.\n![diagram showing use of the second order operators](https://scixplorer.org/help/img/second-order.png) _Usage of the similar( ), trending( ), useful( ), and reviews( ) second-order operators_\n  \n\n**TopN** – returns the list of top N documents for a user defined query, where they are ordered by their default sort order or a user specified sort order. For example:\n```\ntopn(100, database:astronomy, citation_count desc)\n\n```\n\nwill return the top 100 most cited astronomy papers.\nThis next example uses the default sort order for the interior query, so no sort order needs to be specified:\n```\ntrending(topn(10, reviews(\"weak lensing\")))\n\n```\n\nThis query returns papers currently being read by users who are interested in the field of weak lensing.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.

    "content": "## All Entries in the Category \"Searching the SciX\"\n### Search Syntax\n### Search Basics\nSciX’s one box search form supports both fielded and unfielded queries. Unfielded queries without search terms will search the metadata of the publications, including author, publication year, title, abstract, identifiers, and bibstem, which may not produce the expected results. For instance, if you are searching for papers by the author Marc Mars, you want to search for **author:“Mars, Marc”** instead of **Marc Mars** to make sure that you don’t return papers that simply have the words “Marc” and “Mars” somewhere in the article metadata.\n### Fielded Searches\nAbove the search box we supply shortcuts to frequently used search fields. Simply click on the field that you wish to search and enter your search term in the provided location (generally between the supplied quotation marks). Alternatively, if you start entering the name of a field an autocomplete feature will suggest a list of possible search fields. You may string several search terms or use the filters provided with your results to help narrow the search selection. For instance if you want to find articles published between 1980 and 1990 by John Huchra, you can use:\n```\nauthor:\"Huchra, John\" year:1980-1990\n\n```\n\nTo get you started, here is a list of search examples for commonly used fields:\nExample Query | Explanation  \n---|---  \nauthor:“huchra, john” | search for papers written by an author  \nauthor:“^huchra, john” | limit search to first-author papers  \n^“huchra, john” | limit search to first-author papers  \nabs:“dark energy” | search for the phrase “dark energy” in abstract, title and keywords  \nyear:2000 | search for publications written in 2000  \nyear:2000-2005 | search for publications written between 2000 and 2005 (inclusive)  \nbody:“gravitational waves” | search for papers containing the phrase “gravitational waves” in the body of an article  \nfull:“gravitational waves” | search for papers containing the phrase “gravitational waves” in a number of fields (title, abstract, body, acknowledgements and keywords)  \nbibstem:ApJ | select papers published in a particular publication  \nobject:((SMC OR LMC) AND M31) | using the SIMBAD and NED object search, find papers tagged with either SMC or LMC and M31  \nThe rest of this page goes over the search syntax and fields indexed in our database.\n### Combining Search Terms to Make a Compound Query\nYou can string together any number of search terms to develop a query. By default search terms will be combined using AND as the default boolean operator, but this can be changed by explicitly specifying OR beween them. Similarly one can exclude a term by prepending a “-“ sign to it (or using the boolean “NOT”). Multiple search words or phrases may be grouped in a fielded query by enclosing them in parenthesis. Some examples:\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \nabstract:(QSO “dark energy”) | papers containing both “QSO” and “dark energy” in their abstract  \nabstract:(QSO OR “dark energy”) | papers containing either “QSO” or “dark energy in their abstract  \nauthor:“huchra, j” abstract:cfa | papers by J. Huchra which have “cfa” in their abstract  \nauthor:“huchra, j” OR abstract:“great wall” | papers by J. Huchra or which mention “great wall” in their abstract  \nauthor:“huchra, j” -title:2mass | papers by “J. Huchra” but excludes ones with “2mass” in their title  \nauthor:“huchra, j” NOT title:2mass | same as above  \nauthor:“accomazzi, a.” author:“kurtz, m.” | papers authored by both A. Accomazzi and M. Kurtz  \nauthor:(“accomazzi, a.” “kurtz, m.”) | same as above  \n**Operator precedence in multi-part searches**\nSearches involving only two search terms, as shown above, are straightforward to parse. However, for searches with multiple search terms and multiple operators, understanding how operators take precendence over each other is important. For the most control, use parentheses around terms and operators that should be executed first. Otherwise, operators follow these general rules:\n  * AND, OR, and NOT are set operators, operating on the search terms on either side. AND takes the intersection of the result set of the two search terms, OR takes the union, and NOT takes the difference. NOT takes precendence over AND, which takes precendence over OR.\n  * The default AND (i.e., not typing out AND but using just a blank space between the two terms, as in the first example above) has lower precedence than any of the Boolean operators above.\n  * The negative sign (-) is read as “prohibit”; results containing this term are completely excluded. In multi-part queries, its behavior can differ from that of NOT, because of the precedence rules.\n\nExample Query | Parsed as  \n---|---  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” AND Taiwan) | aff:(China OR (“Hong Kong” AND Taiwan))  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” Taiwan) | aff:((China OR “Hong Kong”) AND Taiwan)  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” NOT Taiwan) | aff:(China OR (“Hong Kong” NOT Taiwan))  \naff:(China OR “Hong Kong” -Taiwan) | aff:((China OR “Hong Kong”) NOT Taiwan)  \nFor a more heavy handed exploration of the search syntax, feel free to visit the [search parser details page](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-parser).\n### Synonyms and Acronyms\nBy default most search terms in SciX are expanded by adding a list of words which are synonyms of the search term. So for example, a search of “star” in the title field will be expanded to include words such as “stars,” “stellar,” “starry,” “starlike,” and so on. (Notice that this often includes words in foreign languages such as “etoile,” “stern,” and “stella”). While this feature improves recall, it sometimes compromises the precision of the results. Our search engine allows one to turn off the synonym expansion feature by simply prepending an “=” sign in front of the search term.\nOur search engine also identifies acronyms during indexing and searching (defined as words consisting entirely of uppercase characters). A search for an uppercase word will only match documents which contain that acronym, whereas a search for a lowercase word will match documents which contain any variation of the word, irregardless of its case. Acronyms can themselves have synonyms (for example “SciX” and “Astrophysics Data System” are synonyms), so one should be aware that there is an interaction between case-sensitiveness and synonym expansion. The examples below illustrate these effects:\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \ntitle:star | title contains “star”, any of its synonyms, or the acronym “STAR”  \ntitle:etoile | title contains “star” or any of its synonyms (etoile being a synonym of star);   \nthe results differ from above since “STAR” is not searched for  \n=title:star | title contains “star” or the acronym “STAR”  \n=title:etoile | title contains “etoile”  \ntitle:STAR | title contains the acronym “STAR”  \ntitle:(=star -STAR) | title contains “star” but not the acronym “STAR”  \nfuse | the word “fuse” or acronym “FUSE” appear anywhere in the paper  \nFUSE | the acronym “FUSE” appears anywhere in paper  \n### Author Searches\nSynoym expansion also applies to author names, which provide a way to account for changes in a person’s name and/or different spellings due to transliterations. In addition to this, the default author search in SciX is “greedy” in the sense that it will return all documents in which an author signature may match the input search string. This allows, for instance, to have an author search for “Huchra, John” to return papers where the author name appears as “Huchra, John” or “Huchra, J.” By prepending the “=” character to the author search one can disable this feature (as well as any additional synonym expansion) and require an exact match on the author name. Some examples:\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \nauthor:\"murray, s\" | Least precise variations: finds records authored by any of the following:\n  * Murray, Stephen S.\n  * Murray, Stephen\n  * Murray, S. S. \n  * Murray, S.\n  * Murray, Stephen D.\n  * Murray, S. D.\n  * Murray, Sarah S.\n  * Murray, Scott\n  * ...\n\n(any possible combination with last name \"murray\" and first name starting with S)   \nauthor:\"murray, stephen\" | More precise variations: finds record authored by any of the following: \n  * Murray, Stephen S.\n  * Murray, Stephen\n  * Murray, S. S.\n  * Murray, S.\n  * Murray, Stephen D.\n  * Murray, S. D.\n  * ...\n\n(any possible variation of \"Murray, Stephen\" with or without middle name)  \nauthor:\"murray, stephen s\" | Most precise variations: finds record authored by any of the following: \n  * Murray, Stephen S.\n  * Murray, Stephen\n  * Murray, S. S.\n  * Murray, S.\n\n(any possible variation of \"Murray, Stephen S\" but no others)  \n=author:\"murray, s\" | Matches only records authored by \"Murray, S.\"  \n=author:\"murray, stephen\" | Matches only records authored by \"Murray, Stephen\"  \n=author:\"murray, stephen s\" | Matches only records authored by \"Murray, Stephen S.\"  \nAs a general rule we recommend to use the full name of the person for author searches since as can be seen above the matching rules in SciX are designed to find the maximal set of records consistent with the author specification given by the user. Rather than disabling the name-variation algorithm described above, we recommend performing refinement of search results via the user interface filters for author names as described in the [“Filter your search” section](https://scixplorer.org/help/search/filter).\nThe logic behind the author search is rather complicated, if you would like to learn more, visit the [advanced author search page](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/author-search).\n### Affiliation Searches\nAffiliations in SciX have been indexed in several different search fields, with the intention of allowing multiple use cases. We have currently assigned affiliation identifiers allowing for parent/child relationships, such as an academic department within a university. Note that a child may have multiple parents, but we restrict a child from having children of its own. The list of recognized institutions is available from our [Canonical Affiliation repository](https://github.com/adsabs/CanonicalAffiliations/blob/master/parent_child.tsv) on Github.\nExample Query | Results  \n---|---  \naff:“UCLA” | Searches the raw affiliation string, searchable word-by-word  \ninst:“UCLA” | Searches the curated institution name listed in our mapping of organizations to identifiers, which returns all variations of UCLA (e.g. UCLA; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California - Los Angeles)  \nFor a breakdown to department level:\n  * Use the “Institutions” filter in the left panel of search results\n  * Use parent/child syntax as defined in our list of Canonical Affiliations linked above (e.g. inst:“UCLA/IGPP”)\n\n\nUsers are reminded that while affiliation information is largely complete for recent refereed literature, not all records contain an affiliation; therefore, searching by affiliation alone will inherently be incomplete. We strongly recommend combining affiliation searches with author searches for best results.\n### Astronomical Objects and Position Search\nThe query modifier `object:` in fielded searches allows users to search the literature for bibliographic records that have been tagged with astronomical objects by SIMBAD and NED, or for a specified position on the sky (“cone search”). The cone search also makes use of services offered by SIMBAD and NED.\nQueries for astronomical objects via `object:` queries return publications that have been tagged with the canonical names for these objects. This tagging has been done by the SIMBAD and NED teams. Additionally, the object names (as specified in the query) are also used in a SciX query against abstracts, titles and keywords in the astronomy collection (with synonym replacement switched off). The result set is a combination of all these matches. Object queries that target just one service (e.g. SIMBAD) are not currently supported. The `data` facet can be used to filter the results set.\nThe syntax for cone searches is:\n```\n  object:\"RA ±Dec:radius\"\n\n```\n\nwhere RA and Dec are right ascention and declination J2000 positions, expressed in decimal degrees or in sexagesimal notation (hours minutes seconds and degrees arcmin and arcsec). The plus or minus sign before the declination is **_mandatory_**. The search radius may be given in arcmin, decimal or sexagesimal degrees (The default search radius is 2’, and the maximum is 60’). Examples:\n  * A 10’ radius may be written as 0.1667 or 0 10\n  * The following 3 notations are equivalent: \n    1. 05h23m34.6s -69d45m22s\n    2. 05 23 34.6 -69 45 22\n    3. 80.894167 -69.756111\n\n\nSearching for publications tagged with objects returned by the coordinates in the example above, with a search radius of 10’ is done as follows:\n```\nobject:\"05h23m34.6s -69d45m22s:0.1667\"\n\n```\n\n### Wildcards, Proximity, and Regular expression search\nExample Query | Explanation  \n---|---  \nauthor:“huchra, jo*” | multi-character wildcard; search for papers written by `huchra, john`, `huchra, jonathan`, `huchra, jolie`, and anything in between  \nauthor:“bol?,” | single-character wildcard; in this case we may get back `bolt`, `boln`, `bolm`  \ntitle:(map NEAR5 planar) | instead of a phrase search, we can ask the search engine to consider words be close to each other – the maximum allowed distance is 5; the operator must be written as `NEAR[number]`; in this example the search terms can appear in any order but there will be at most 5 other terms between (not counting stopwords such as `a`, `the`, `in`…). **The proximity search must be used only against fielded search, i.e. inside one index. You cannot use proximity search to find an author name next to a title**. If you are looking for token that appear next to each other, then please use a phrase search. For fields that are not tokenized (such as author names) use semicolon as a separator, e.g. `author:\"kurtz, m; accomazzi, a\" OR author:\"accomazzi, a; kurtz, m\"` – in a phrase search the order is important, so we much try both variants.  \n`facility:/magell.*/` | Regular expression searches are possible but are less useful than you might expect. Firstly, the regex can match only against indexed tokens - i.e. it is not possible to search for multiple words next to each other. So in practice, this type of search is more useful for fields that contain `string` tokens (as opposed to `text` tokens). In practice, this means that a field which contains many words (such as `title`, `abstract`, `body`) is a text field, but a field with only limited number of values is typically defined as a `string` - for example, `author`, `facility`, `page`. You can use regex in both `string` and `text` fields but you have to be aware that regular expression is only going to match **indexed tokens**. In the case of `string` fields tokens may be multi-word combinations, depending on the specific field. For example, in the `author` field one token is `huchra, john`, but in fulltext the same content will be indexed as two tokens: `huchra`, `john`. In all cases the tokens are normalized (typically by lowercasing the input data). A little bit or more of experimentation (test queries) should be enough to help you determine your ‘adversary’. For description of allowed regex patterns, please see: [Lucene documentation](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_0_1/core/org/apache/lucene/util/automaton/RegExp.html)  \n### Available Fields\nThis is a list of fields currently recognized by SciX search engine and the preferred search format - go to [comprehensive list of fields](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/comprehensive-solr-term-list) if not saturated yet:\nField Name | Syntax | Example | Notes  \n---|---|---|---  \nAbstract/Title/Keywords | abs:“phrase” | abs:“dark energy” | search for word or phrase in abstract, title and keywords  \nAbstract | abstract:“phrase” | abstract:“dark energy” | search for a word or phrase in an abstract only  \nAcknowledgements | ack:“phrase” | ack:“SciX” | search for a word or phrase in the acknowledgements  \nAffiliation | aff:“phrase” | aff:“harvard” | search for word or phrase in the raw, provided affiliation field  \nAffiliation ID | aff_id:ID | aff_id:A00211 | search for an affiliation ID listed in the [Canonical Affiliations list](https://github.com/adsabs/CanonicalAffiliations/blob/master/parent_child.tsv) in the _child_ column.

In most cases, filtering of results based on these fields is available in the user interface.\n### Properties\nThe “properties” search field allows one to restrict the search results to papers which belong to a particular class. The allowed properties currently include:\nProperty flag | Selection  \n---|---  \nads_openaccess | An OA version of article is available from SciX  \narticle | The record corresponds to a regular article  \nassociated | The record has associated articles available  \nauthor_openaccess | An author-submitted OA version is available  \ndata | One or more data links are available, see `data` field  \neprint_openaccess | An OA version of article is available from a preprint server (e.g. arXiv)  \nesource | An electronic source is available, see `esource` field  \ninspire | A corresponding record is available in the INSPIRE database  \nlibrary_catalog | A corresponding record is available from a library catalog  \nnonarticle | The record is not a regular article; applies to e.g. meeting abstracts, software, catalog descriptions, etc  \nnotrefereed | The record is not peer reviewed (refereed)  \nocr_abstract | The record’s abstract was generated from OCR (may contain typos or mistakes)  \nopenaccess | The record has at least one openaccess version available  \npresentation | The record has one or more media presentations associated with it  \npub_openaccess | An OA version of article is available from publisher  \nrefereed | The record is peer reviewed (refereed)  \ntoc | The record has a Table Of Content (TOC) associated with it  \n### Bibliographic Groups\nThe “bibgroup” search field allows restriction of the search results to one of the [SciX bibliographic groups](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/data_faq-scix/bibgroups). These groups are curated by a number of librarians and archivists who maintain either institutional or “telescope” bibliographies on behalf of their projects. Here is a partial list. For more information on the criteria behind the curation of these groups, please see the link above.\nThe list of current Institutional bibgroups is: ARI, CfA, CFHT, Leiden, USNO\nThe list of current Telescope bibgroups is: ALMA, CXC, ESO, Gemini, Herschel, HST, ISO, IUE, JCMT, Keck, Magellan, NOIRLab, NRAO, ROSAT, SDO, SMA, Spitzer, Subaru, Swift, UKIRT, XMM\n### Data Links\nThe “property:data” search field can be used to select papers which have data links associated to them. The list of archives which SciX links to can be seen under the “Data” filter selection. To generate a list of all records which have data links one can issue a simple query: [property:data](https://scixplorer.org/search?q=property%3Adata&sort=date+desc). Using the property:data search field allows one to focus on data-rich papers, for example:\n```\nproperty:data AND (CXO OR XMM) AND HST\n\n```\n\nFinds multi-wavelength papers which have observations both in the X-ray spectrum (from Chandra or XMM) and in the optical (HST). Of course additional search terms can be used to further refine the selection criteria.\n### Document Type\nRecords in SciX are assigned a document type which is indexed in the “doctype” search field, the contents of which are an extension of the [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) entry types. Currently these are the document types indexed by SciX:\nDocument Type | Resource associated with record  \n---|---  \narticle | journal article  \neprint | preprinted article  \ninproceedings | article appearing in a conference proceedings  \ninbook | article appearing in a book  \nabstract | meeting abstract  \nbook | book (monograph)  \nbookreview | published book review  \ncatalog | data catalog (or other high-level data product)  \ncircular | printed or electronic circular  \nerratum | erratum to a journal article  \nmastersthesis | Masters thesis  \nnewsletter | printed or electronic newsletter  \nobituary | obituary (article containing “obituary” in its title)  \nphdthesis | PhD thesis  \npressrelease | press release  \nproceedings | conference proceedings book  \nproposal | observing or funding proposal  \nsoftware | software package  \ntalk | research talk given at a scholarly venue  \ntechreport | technical report  \nmisc | anything not found in the above list  \n### Citation and Reference Operators\nWhen you submit a query, SciX returns a list of search results. Should you want a list of all the articles which **cite those search results** , or all the articles which **are referenced by those search results** , you can use the citation or reference operators.\nThe syntax for these operators are _references(query)_ and _citations(query)_.\nExample Query | Explanation  \n---|---  \ncitations(author:“huchra, john”) | returns the list of records citing John Huchra’s papers  \nreferences(bibcode:2003AJ….125..525J) | returns records cited by the paper 2003AJ….125..525J  \ncitations(abstract:JWST) | returns records citing papers which have “JWST” in their abstract  \nreferences(data:Chandra) | returns records cited by papers in the Chandra data bibliography  \nOne powerful aspect of having these operators at our disposal when creating a query is that we can combine them with additional search terms to expand or narrow your query. For example, the following query finds all papers which cite [the original JWST paper](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2006SSRv..123..485G/abstract) as well as papers which contain the terms “Webb” or “JWST” in their abstract:\n```\ncitations(bibcode:2006SSRv..123..485G) OR abstract:(Webb OR JWST)\n\n```\n\n### Second-Order Queries\nWe provide five second-order operators which modify the query results by performing second-order operations on the original query. Theese operators are database functions which form secondary queries based on attributes of the objects returned in an initial query; they can provide powerful methods to investigate complex, multipartite information graphs. To invoke the operators, enter the corresponding operator before your search terms (enclosing your search terms in parentheses) in the search box. The search terms enclosed by parentheses are considered the first-order query.\nIn addition to the basic information provided below, we have [published a tutorial describing these operators in detail](https://scixplorer.org/abs/2020BAAS...52.0207K/abstract), both alone and in conjunction with other functions. It is intended for scientists and others who wish to make fuller use of the SciX database.\n**Similar** - The _similar_ operator takes the text of the abstracts of the papers in the first-order query, combines them into a single “document,” then ranks all the abstracts in SciX by their text-based similarity to this combined document, and returns the ranked list. The returned results exclude the articles returned by the first-order query. The documents returned are the most similar, as determined via text analysis, to the topic being researched, while excluding the original documents. For example:\n```\nsimilar(bibcode:2000A&AS..143...41K)\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers that are textually similar to the given paper, while excluding the given paper from the results.\nThe next example:\n```\nsimilar(\"weak lensing\" -entdate:[NOW-7DAYS TO *]) entdate:[NOW-7DAYS TO *] bibstem:\"arXiv\"\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of recent arXiv papers that are textually similar to older papers about weak lensing. Note that since the similar operator excludes results returned by the first-order query, we here use separate date ranges in the first-order query and the outer query in order to force the queries to be disjoint.\n**Trending** – The _trending_ operator takes the lists of readers who read the papers in the first-order query, finds the lists of papers which each of them read, combines these lists, and returns the combined list, sorted by frequency of appearance. The documents returned are most read by users who read recent papers on the topic being researched; these are papers currently being read by people interested in this field. For example:\n```\ntrending(exoplanets)\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers which are currently popular among the readers interested in exoplanets.\n**Useful** – The _useful_ operator takes the reference lists from the papers in the first-order query, combines them and returns this list, sorted by how frequently a referenced paper appears in the combined list. The documents returned are frequently cited by the most relevant papers on the topic being researched; these are studies which discuss methods and techniques useful to conduct research in this field. For example:\n```\nuseful(\"galaxy surveys\")\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers spanning a variety of topics useful to researchers interested in analyzing surveys of galaxies.\n**Reviews** – The _reviews_ operator takes the lists of articles which cited the papers in the first-order query, combines them, and returns this list sorted by how frequently a citing paper appears in the combined list. The documents returned cite the most relevant papers on the topic being researched; these are papers containing the most extensive reviews of the field. For example:\n```\nreviews(\"weak lensing\")\n\n```\n\nwill return a ranked list of papers featuring reviews of weak gravitational lensing and its cosmological implications.\n![diagram showing use of the second order operators](https://scixplorer.org/help/img/second-order.png) _Usage of the similar( ), trending( ), useful( ), and reviews( ) second-order operators_\n  \n\n**TopN** – returns the list of top N documents for a user defined query, where they are ordered by their default sort order or a user specified sort order. For example:\n```\ntopn(100, database:astronomy, citation_count desc)\n\n```\n\nwill return the top 100 most cited astronomy papers.\nThis next example uses the default sort order for the interior query, so no sort order needs to be specified:\n```\ntrending(topn(10, reviews(\"weak lensing\")))\n\n```\n\nThis query returns papers currently being read by users who are interested in the field of weak lensing.\n### Filter Your Search\nOnce you have a results list from an initial query you can use our filters to further refine your search. Your results list will change each time you apply a limit.\nClicking on any of the listed terms within a filter will automatically apply that term as a filter. If you choose a single term from a given filter, you will be prompted to **limit to** or **exclude** the search term from the list of results; if you choose more than one term from within a single filter, you will be prompted to select **and** (results must contain all of the selected terms), **or** (results must contain at least one of the selected terms), or **exclude** (results must not contain the selected terms).\n### Available filters\n  * _Authors_ : filter individual authors in the results list\n  * _Collections_ : include or exclude results from the astronomy, physics, earth science, and general collections\n  * _Refereed status_ : include or exclude refereed or non-refereed publications\n  * _Institutions_ : include or exclude results from the curated [canonical affiliations](https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/affiliations-feature) that were found in the results of your original query\n  * _Keywords_ : include or exclude keywords that were found in the results of your original query\n  * _Publications_ : include or exclude journals that were found in the results of your original query\n  * _Bib Groups_ : include or exclude results from curated [bibliographic groups](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-syntax#bibliographic-groups)\n  * _SIMBAD Objects_ : include or exclude results that contain [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) object types or individual objects\n  * _NED Objects_ : include or exclude results that contain [NED](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/) object types or individual objects\n  * _Data_ : include or exclude results that contain data in various archives (e.g. CDS, HEASARC, CXO, NED)\n  * _Vizier Tables_ : include or exclude results that have [Vizier](https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR) tables or catalogs\n  * _Publication Type_ : include or exclude records based on the document type\n\n\n### Example\n  1. Search for _author:“Huchra, John”_.\n  2. Open the author filter; you will get a list that includes “Geller, M” and “Illingworth, G.” If you want the articles in which “Geller, M.” is a coauthor with “Huchra, John” you would click on the name “Geller, M.” in the list.\n  3. If you want the articles in which either “Geller, M.” or “Illingworth, G” were coauthors you would click the boxes next to both of their names and choose “or” from the selection box. If you want the articles in which both “Geller, M.” and “Illingworth, G” were coauthors you would click the boxes next to both of their names and choose “and” from the selection box. (There should be zero results for this query!)\n\n\n### Positional Field Searches\nThe _pos()_ operator allows you to search for an item within a field by specifying the position in the field. The syntax for this operator is _pos(fieldedquery,position,[endposition])_. If no _endposition_ is given, then it is assumed to be _endposition = position_ , otherwise this performs a query within the range _[position, endposition]_ where _position_ is the leftmost position considered and _endposition_ is the rightmost. For example:\nExample | Results  \n---|---  \npos(author:”Oort, J”,2) | papers that have “J. Oort” as the second author  \npos(author:”Oort, J”,2,2) | same as above  \npos(author:”Oort, J”,1,3) | papers that have “J. Oort” as first, second, or third author  \npos(author:”Oort, J”,-1) | papers that have “J. Oort” as the last author, could be only author  \npos(author:”Oort, J”,-2,-1) | papers that have “J. Oort” as either of the last two authors  \npos(aff:harvard,1) | papers for which the first author has a Harvard affiliation  \npos(title:M31,1) | papers for which the title starts with “M31”  \nCurrently the _pos()_ operator works on these fields: _author_ , _aff_ , _title_.\n### Last Author\nFor the special case of last author searches, a template is available from the all search terms dropdown menu for every disciplinary interface.

We’ll break it down further into:\n  1. parsing text into the AST (abstract syntax tree)\n  2. modifying the query tree (semantic parsing)\n  3. building the query object\n\n\n### Building the Query\nThe [Search Grammar](https://github.com/adsabs/montysolr/blob/main/montysolr/src/main/antlr/ADS.g) defines the search language of SciX. It is a context-free grammar and it is used to generate a client library ([by ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)).\nIf you don’t like reading context-free computer grammars (who does?) you’ll find a good explanation of SciX syntax here: [search syntax help](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-syntax).\nBut as a reward for having found this obscure corner of the help, we’ll illustrate a few more special situations not covered there.\n### Operators\nThe search operators have the following precedence (from higher to lower priority): `NEARx -> NOT -> AND -> OR -> \" \"`\nSome details worth mentioning:\n**Empty space is the default AND**\nBetter to illustrate it by way of examples:\n`jim and john not mary` becomes behind the scenes: `(jim AND (john NOT mary))` because `NOT` has precedence over `AND`. But `john jim and mary` becomes `(john AND (jim AND mary))` because `AND` operator has precedence over empty space (operator) – notice how `jim and mary` is evaluated as a group: i.e. the query is **not** parsed as `john AND jim AND mary`.\n**You can modify the default operator**\nIt can also be changed on demand by adding `q.op=OR` into URL parameters (i.e. NOT inside the search form), in which case the logic will change dramatically. For any given query the results will contain many more records, but if sorted by relevancy score, the top items will be still the ones returned with the default `AND` operator.\n**SciX supports proximity searches for text fields**\nYes, many people may not know about it, but you can do stuff like: `title:(dog NEAR5 cat)` – this will find any mention of the barking animal appearing up to 5 text words (tokens) from the meowing animal. The `NEAR` has to be followed by a number [1-5] and it will not care about the order; i.e. `cat NEAR5 dog` == `dog NEAR5 cat` – this search can be very powerful, especially if applied against fulltext. It can also be quite expensive (computationally) - especially when the search term(s) have synonyms. Use this operator with fielded queries on text fields such as `full`, `abs`, `title`.\n**There is no in-order proximity operator, but SciX still supports this feature**\nSciX has a limited support for **in-order proximity** - if you make a phrase search like so `abs:\"newtonian solar\"~3` the word `newtonian` (and its synonyms) will have to be followed by `solar` (and its synonyms) for up to 3 positions away. We do not have a special operator for it though; if what you search for has more than 2 words, we’ll decide how far apart they can be. For example if you do `abs:\"one two three\"~3` then `one` may be 3 words away from `two three` (and it doesn’t matter that there are really 4 tokens between `one` and `three`).\n### Syntax Parsing\nOK, so back to the syntactic parsing – how does it actually work? We have a formal grammar which describes the query language. Based on that, we have generated a library (in Java) which is included inside SOLR, our search engine. When SOLR receives the user input, before it can start searching for documents, the user query (string) will be turned into a query object. And that is the objective of the parser. First comes the syntactic phase during which an ANTLR parser will be ‘eating’ input character by character. It will occassionally veer off to explore a possible (alternative) branch, to either pursue it further or return back and start branching from some previous position. The input has to be syntactically correct; if we explored all possible readings and there are still some input characters left, it means the input is non-conforming and we’ll generate an exception and give up.\nIf the query is correct, however, after the parser is finished parsing, we’ll have the **AST** (Abstract Syntax Tree): a hierarchical datastructure (a tree) instead of the flat chain of characters.\nHere an example (it is only an illustration, inside the search engine the AST will be richer):\n```\n\"(this) (that)\" \t->\t\n                            (DEFOP \n(CLAUSE (                               (CLAUSE (\n    DEFOP (                                 DEFOP (\n        MODIFIER (                              MODIFIER (\n            TMODIFIER (                             TMODIFIER (\n                FIELD (                                 FIELD (\n                    QNORMAL this))))))                      QNORMAL that)))))))\n\n```\n\nIn human words: the input `(this) (that)` has been parsed into an `AST`; the tree starts at a `DEFOP` node (default operator) which has two children (`CLAUSE`s). Each `CLAUSE` itself is made of a strict chain of components: `DEFOP->MODIFIER->TMODIFIER->FIELD` – they are all empty (with implicit value of none). It is only after we have arrived to a terminus `QNORMAL` that we also see values. Inside the tree, we will have information about every bracket, position, and links to parent/children.\nThis tree will be further modified in the next phase.\n### Semantic Parsing\nThere is a lot of magic that happens in this next phase. All of it is defined inside the [pipeline](https://github.com/adsabs/montysolr/blob/main/montysolr/src/main/java/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/flexible/aqp/AqpAdsabsNodeProcessorPipeline.java).\nPro tip: if you add `debugQuery=true` to your search request URL parameters (and look at the data as returned by our API), you’ll see the serialized version of the query as parsed by SOLR. For example\n```\n\"debug\":{\n    \"rawquerystring\":\"abs:\\\"newtonian solar\\\"~3\",\n    \"querystring\":\"abs:\\\"newtonian solar\\\"~3\",\n    \"parsedquery\":\"CustomScoreQuery(custom(abstract:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 title:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 keyword:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3, sum(float(cite_read_boost),const(0.5))))\",\n    \"parsedquery_toString\":\"custom(abstract:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 title:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3 keyword:\\\"syn::newton syn::solar\\\"~3, sum(float(cite_read_boost),const(0.5)))\",\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\n### (Advanced) Author Search\nThe following section describes, in ugly detail, the logic of author parsing and searching.\n## Referenced resources\n## Big Picture\nWhat happens when we search for `author:\"Adamczuk, Peter\"`?\nFirst, the query string is turned into an abstract syntax tree (see [search parser](https://scixplorer.org/scixhelp/search-scix/search-parser) for details). The query parser will see that we are searching the field `author` and apply the tokenizer chain (rules) specified for that field. So it will run the input through the author tokenizer, which has a number of steps involved in transforming the input text into what gets indexed and searched.\nThere is also quite a difference between what we do at **index** time, and at the **search** time in order to optimize searches and maximize both precision and recall.\n### Details\nLet’s consider as an example the case of an author whose full name is `Adamčuk, Piotr Gavrilov Eugenyi`.\nPeople using our search engine may be unable to remember all his names, misremember the last name as `Adamczuk`, assume his first name with `Peter` (which he has occasionally published under), and not know about his additional middle names `Gavrilov` and `Eugenyi` which might have been transcribed in the past in multiple ways such as `Evgenij`, `Eugenij`, `Eugen`, `Evzen`.\nAs you can imagine, balancing accuracy and retrieval for author names searches is going to be tricky. Let’s imagine that a user searches for this scientist’s paper using the following query:\n```\nauthor:\"peter adamczuk\"\n\n```\n\n#### Normalization\nThe first step we perform is name normalization, in order to ensure that the author name is properly formatted. Our _search_ tokenizer is going to take the input in its entirety (the full string `peter adamczuk` with **NO** tokenization into `peter` and `adamczuk`) and will pass the input to a [name parsing Python library](https://pypi.org/project/nameparser/). Since the search engine is written in Java, in reality the library will be executed by [Jython](https://www.jython.org/).\nThe library will parse the input string to identify its components: surname, first name, and optionally middle name(s), titles, suffixes, etc. So `Pope John Paul the II` would lose all his titles and be normalized to `Paul, John, II`. In our example, `Peter` is recognized as the first name, and `Adamczuk` as the last name.\nNormalization also involves removal of excessive whitespace, punctuation, hyphens, apostrophes, etc. For example, `Adamczuk  ,               P ` becomes `Adamczuk, P`, and `Lao'tzu` becomes `Lao tzu,`. We also limit the number of names allowed for a single author to 6 tokens.\n#### Transliteration\nThe next step involves name transliterations, which map “similar” classes of characters to a common format. English is the Lingua Franca of scientific discourse, but author names span a huge variety of character sets. Transliterations allow author names containing a variety of accented characters to be found when searching for their ASCII equivalent. For example, a search for `jonas` would find the name `jonáš` as well. Internally in our database we use the `UTF-8` character encoding so that we can properly represent the original author name but we don’t force the English-centric writers to think in more than 26 characters of the English alphabet.\nSo in the case of `adamczuk, p` at this stage we will discover that the SciX database contains `adamčuk, peter` and any of its variations such as `adamčuk, p` if present.\nHow are transliterations generated and managed? We periodically go through our author index and for each name not already in ASCII format we generate its equivalent mappings, for example:\n```\nadamczuk, p => adamčuk, p\nadamczuk, peter => adamčuk, peter\nadamczuk, piotr => adamčuk, piotr\n\n```\n\nSome of the transliteration rules are custom to SciX, but the majority stemming from Java Unidecode library. The generated vocabulary of names has at this point millions of entries and contains every non-Latin character that has ever appeared in the SciX author database. The dictionary is then used (at search time) to lookup `UTF-8` variants when users give us an `ASCII` name.\n#### Synonyms\nNormalization and transliteration transform the original input from `peter adamzuk` to `adamczuk, peter`, to (`adamczuk, peter`, `adamčuk, peter`). Next we proceed to discover all other known names of this person. SciX curators maintain a knowledge base of known name changes and aliases for scientists in our database. That is what gets consulted in the next step, where we might discover that `adamčuk, peter` has also published as `adamčuk, piotr` and was previously known as `adamčuková, petra`, in which case we augment our name search to include the additional variation.\nSo the parser will tentatively generate a multitude of possible names and spellings and will use them all to search for them. As a way of example, this is what we’ll get:\n  * adamzuk, peter\n  * adamczuk, peter\n  * adamčuk, peter\n  * adamčuk, piotr\n  * adamčuková, petra\n\n\nAll these names were added because our parser consulted the knowledge base of author names. Our parser doesn’t know this is one and the same person; but it has a way of seeing/discovering the chain of name changes. If the knowledge database is correct, which is most of the time, it will be able to start from the user input and arrive at other names.\nNext, we’ll use all of the author names discovered so far, and take one step further – we’ll generate all the possible name variations that might be derived from them using abbreviations. For example, an author with a middle name such as `John James Doe` might appear in the scientific literature as `Doe, J.`, `Doe, John`, `Doe, John J.`, and possibly `Doe, John James` and `Doe, John J.`\nAt query time, the author search will adapt its strategy based on the user input. If for example the user entered `acamczuk, p` then our parser will assume they are looking for any `adamczuk` whose first name starts with “p” (i.e. `adamczuk, p*`), and give them all peters, piotrs, pauls, pans and pons. However, if the user typed `adamczuk, peter` then the search engine will instead return `adamczuk, peter`, `adamczuk, peter <some other name>`, `adamczuk, p`, `adamczuk, p <some other name>` and all of the variations and synonyms thereof (`adamčuk, peter`, `adamčuková, petra`, `adamčuková, petra *`, etc.)\n### Conclusions\nSo what started as a seemingly simple search has, behind the scenes, transformed into a massive and very complicated query. Our implementation of author searches attempts to strike a balance between the desire to be precise, and the desire to be inclusive (recall). The logic is complex, it takes advantage of what SciX knows about publishing conventions and supplements it with a curated knowledge base, which we regularly update based on user input.\nIf an author search produces unexpected results, it usually is because of these reasons:\n  * the curated knowledge base is too broad or too narrow: i.e. it is missing a synonym, or has a synonym too many – and joins unrelated names together\n  * haphazard interferences: the transliterations as implemented mistakenly map distinct author names to the same equivalent ASCII version, and end up retrieving records authored by distinct scientists with similar names\n\n\nOne possible solution to the ambiguity problem is to perform an exact author search, which bypasses the steps described above by prepending the equal sign (`=`) to the author search field, e.g. `=author:\"adamčuk, peter\"`.\n© The SAO Astrophysics Data System \nSciX is a project created by the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement _80NSSC21M0056_\n[ ![Smithsonian logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/smithsonian.svg) ](http://www.si.edu) [ ![Harvard Center for Astrophysics logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/cfa.png) ](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [ ![NASA logo](https://scixplorer.org/help/common/images/nasa-partner.svg) ](http://www.nasa.gov)\n*The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant or cooperative agreement.
